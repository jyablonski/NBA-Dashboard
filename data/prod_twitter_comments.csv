2022-07-14,lebrowlakers,@look_nba @dlew_44 I agree he improved his passing. I just don‚Äôt buy the idea that he had a worse RS because he was saving it for the PS.

2022-07-14,lebrowlakers,@look_nba @dlew_44 Sure they‚Äôll run him off screens to get him better looks at times.

2022-07-14,lebrowlakers,@look_nba @dlew_44 Tinkering with scheme like that can definitely can definitely make the team worse off in the regular season.

2022-07-14,lebrowlakers,@look_nba @dlew_44 To some degree that speaks to a lack of portability.
