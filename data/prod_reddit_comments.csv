His MVP season he still gets some hate and criticism for it, but tbh I think it was well-deserved and an overall incredible season. But since then his stat-padding only got worse and his reputation declined. Then triple doubles got way watered down. 10 years from now kids will be looking back at Westbrook and laughing at his brick montages and advanced stats and his MVP season won't even be considered impressive anymore due to how we will perceive triple doubles.

Still dumb as hell and dangerous.  Minimum of a flagrant 1.  But he raked across the arm with that second swipe, he never grabbed, so I would not have thought poorly of it if it had been ruled a flagrant 1.  

IT was a dumbass basketball play.  Overly aggressive and not the type of shit you do in a brotherhood where you are all just trying to make a (killer) paycheck in a nights work.  But didn't look like it was contact to head/neck and did look like he was going for ball.

It will happen to Ja Morant. 

I don‚Äôt think their legacies get watered down, I think people accept them for what they were, freak athletes who had 8 years of incredibly entertaining basketball. And those with the right teams can win championships.

He flew to the Virgin Islands before the 1997 draft to learn more about Timmy and to see where he came from. They would have drafted him either way no doubt, but Pop felt like getting to know Timmy in his element.

2022-01-22,WDfx2EU,"Right now the odds have Jokic and Giannis above Embiid for MVP ladder, but if Embiid manages to get this team above .600 he'll win it on narrative. The ladder never factors in narrative considering how much it impacts the decision.

Giannis may deserve it, but is he on the same level as Magic, Bird, Jordan, Kareem, Wilt, Bill Russell, Lebron? Moses Malone won it 3 times so maybe.

**EDIT:** While I definitely agree Giannis should be considered as a 3-time MVP caliber player, I wouldn't say it's an agree upon fact that Giannis is on the same level as those other guys (as some responses suggest). There are a lot of top 10 lists out there and everyone I listed is on most of them. I have yet to see a top 10 all-time list with Giannis on it. I'm **not personally** saying that Giannis won't have the same legacy as those all time greats. I'm just saying not everyone sees him that way quite yet so he probably would have a hard time getting a 3rd MVP right now. Same goes for Steph.

**Bradley Beal:** 13.9 PPG 39.7%  
**Jalen Green:** 15.0 PPG 39.7%

Pretty good list. I also think he's had some real inconsistent minutes and did not go to the best situation for him entirely (players do not grow in vacuums). Given all that he's actually playing better than he should be.

Dude will be fine. I was lowkey hoping Charlotte would somehow jump up in the draft and Jalen slip because a LaMelo Ball/Jalen Green backcourt is pretty much a perfect fit. A pairing like that or Luka/Green would be ultimate chemistry down the road.

it's a hard foul, and probably a flagrant 1 for the follow-through 

but I really don't think he was actively trying to contort Caruso mid-air the way he did. people don't realize how hard it is to perfectly avoid contact when you're at full momentum caught in the air like that

as for the giggling, I've read in this thread that it was directed towards some fans heckling him (crowd was nearly half Chicago fans) 

even as a Bucks fan I've never liked Grayson cause of his antics, and I'm ready to condemn him if it happens, but I don't think this is it. it's because of his reputation. overall this year he has been fine from what I've seen.",NA,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/s9shuy/richard_jefferson_grayson_allen_giggling_after/,0.934,0.182,0.727,0.091

2022-01-22,hari_son_of,"If I'm not considering health, they are close enough that it would come down to roster construction. Jokic runs the offense while embiid is the offense if that makes sense. Like kd just hand embiid the ball and he can get u a bucket. With jokic your back court can function with 1 SG and a Pg/SG hybrid because jokic does so much of the play making, they just gotta develop a 2 man game with jokic and learn how to cut off ball. I'd argue that embiid is a better scorer (his PTS per 100 are historic if I recall) but he ideally should pair with someone who can set the table for him. Jokic has gotten alot better defensively this year and is super smart with his positioning and timing but embiid has far better physical tools on that end and offers more rim protection. Overall I'd still take jokic but i'm biased obviously.

2022-01-22,smashacc,I don't think Wall is a better player than Westbrook (unless Russ continues to shoot 40% on layups and 20% on field goals). But he is a much better fit. He tries more on defense (or at the least has much better defensive IQ) and I think he has better IQ in general. And Wall isn't a good shooter but he would still be a decent spacing upgrade over Russ. I think he'd perform better on a contender than on a tanking team like the rockets solely due to increase in effort.,West,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/s9k9fe/stein_there_is_at_least_one_team_out_there_that/,0.9778,0.299,0.656,0.045

2022-01-22,HisExcellency20,"Ben is a good player. Not only that he is the reason people thought Harris could be an All Star last season. *He* is the Tobias whisperer. Seriously he puts him in position to just take shots and not have to do anything else, and even makes his defense better by giving him easier assignments. Without Ben Harris is borderline unplayable. He has to create for himself and he just can't. 

If Ben were to up and decide to play tomorrow you would see a DRASTIC improvement in Harris' game and people would think it happened magically. Harris should have been at the press conference in front of Ben with a literal shield because he's the reason people thought he was good.",76ers,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/s9rpqq/joel_embiid_in_loss_vs_the_clippers_40pts_13_rebs/,0.9595,0.171,0.816,0.013

Mortgage default swaps are essentially insurance for (subprime) mortgages. During the great financial crisis the institutions who sold then got super fucked since they had to cover for all the bad loans.

2022-01-22,wallitron,"Add up the assets the Lakers gave up to land Davis and Westbrook. Sure, they ""chose"" to go to LA, but you need assets to be a trade destination.

Between landing Howard in 2012 and now, the only major asset that the Lakers got in free agency is LeBron.

The Lakers had 6 sub 40 win seasons, and traded or let go every single player they drafted during that time. They've traded most of their picks for the next 3 years. They are paying Westbrook $47M next year.

His minutes are inconsistent because he's not good enough yet.
Rockets this year are 0.0 in net rating when Green is OFF. It's pretty crazy to think about considering their record and how their team is right now. But when Green is ON the floor, they get outscored by -17.6 per 100 possession. 

Green averages 14.4 on 38.1%, has the worst plus/minus among this rookie class. Also he's pretty much the only 1st rounder this year to average more TO than assist.

2022-01-22,OneOfTheManySams,"Green has shown some great scoring promise and had some very nice games. But he really needs to start finding more avenues to score because he is starting to look a bit one dimensional.

I can't speak for the other players rookie seasons, but Booker showed his range that he could score from anywhere on the court in his rookie season. Half of his attempts were from 3 ft out to the 3 point line and compared to Green who has attempted just over 20% from that range with shocking efficiency.

He has been less efficient than Booker in every single spot on the floor, from 0-3 all the way to 3 pointers themselves, especially in the midrange and corner 3s he has been significantly less efficient.

Now obviously this isn't a fair comparison, Green has only played half of his first season. But his form is not good and he just can't get to his spots to score, which just leads to this super inefficient chucking. I do think he will turn it around, but he is looking more raw than anyone expected him to be.",Suns,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/s9v6n8/jalen_green_tonight_3_pts_011_fg_05_3fg_33_ft_3/,0.9473,0.125,0.83,0.045

I was so confused after the first ten games of the season as to why he was so strait faced and so calm 100 percent of the time. I truly think he's been trying to control himself and fix his anger/danger issues. This is the very first sign of anything throughout the entire year. I mean this guy shows zero emotion about a foul compared to anyone I've witnessed in the league this season. It's kind of insane. I actually believe he was going for the ball on the second swipe. And I believe if it was a reputable guy, vs a regular player that isn't charrished by the entire fan base, this would have been a flagrant one and would have gotten hardly anyone's attention. I'm not just being a homer. I hated PJ before he was on our team, while he was on our team, and still hate him.

Plenty of those articles defend them, and say they aren't actually dirty. But what the hell are they defending them from if they didn't have that reputation? Why was Pop sticking up for his guys if nobody was accusing them of being dirty?

Secondly, if an injury is what you're so afraid of, then what's the point of building around Embiid in the first place? We might as well trade him and start over, if that's how you feel.

Why would the Sixers do that? Why would the fans want to do that? We're fans of the team first and foremost, not of Embiid.

The Stepien Rule only dictates that teams must have a first-round pick every other season, but it doesn't need to be their own, so the Lakers can offer swap rights on their 2023 and 2026 picks.""

2022-01-22,RevolutionaryAd9302,"Bucks fan here. Did not get to see this play live.

Slow motion, which is mainly how it has been shown is pretty terrible. I didn't see it live so saw this first. 

Then saw just how quickly it happened in real life. I don't even think it was reckless. He was clearly trying to put a hard foul on Caruso to stop the basket. When he swung around, he was trying to still swipe the ball down, and I can't imagine that in the half second he had the time to think man, this guy is falling to his side, let's see if I can swing him further. 

Absolutely not a play I'd want to see again. But also definitely perceived as super dangerous due to how intentional it seemed in slow motion. I'm fine with the call, as it was clear the ball was not able to go in at the point of the second swipe, but to calculate that in a half second?

Flagrant fouls are highly dependent on context no matter how you slice it. It was near the end of the game and he committed a hard foul that cheapshotted two areas of the body that‚Äôs prone to injury. Did Jokic say he wanted Morris to get hurt? No. He actually admitted that he was wrong to do that. In fact, the issues escalated bec of the tough guy narrative that the Morris brothers and some players/fans wanted to perpetuate via reactions on twitter and on reddit. It then escalated to the Jokic brothers intervening bec they know it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúeuropean white guy‚Äôs league‚Äù out there. As zach randolph said: bullies get bullied. That explains the exaggerated narrative against and for the two. Morris was wrong and Jokic was wrong as well. We could‚Äôve ended with that.

There are probably much harder fouls that have occurred and the guy lands normally and all is good. or some weak guard pushes a guy like Giannis as hard as they can and Giannis barely moves. Why isn‚Äôt that a flagrant? This is why players flop since refs can only base their call on how things look. A hard foul that doesn‚Äôt look like a hard foul is seen as fine.

2022-01-22,MortalTwit,"Right with you.  From what I see in the slow mo replays, he never grabbed.  He got arm instead of ball on the first swipe, and twisted in the air to take another swipe.  Trying to guarantee the foul he was taking would not allow the shot to go up.

If you are going the same direction and can wrap a guy up safely, then fine.  Happens all the time.

If you are flying in at a 90 degree angle, high in the air, swiping blindly, then you are a menace.

IF you go laughing about it - maybe injuring another player, definitely hurting your team's chances by not being available.... I don't understand how he does not get his ass kicked from SOMEONE for this shit.  Some 15th man on a 10 day could earn himself some serious love around the league for doing everything in his power to goad this turd into a fight and then LEVEL him.  Serve your suspension, get on another team.  Do it again.

Rinse and repeat through every single team he has done this crap to.  Return to team 1 to finish out the year.  Maybe get a 2 year min contract.

I don‚Äôt choose who wins it. The people who do vote always factor in the overall legacy and narrative, and I‚Äôm just explaining why they are more likely to vote for Embiid with that in mind. It will always be easier for players to get the first MVP than it will to get the 2nd & 3rd.

2022-01-22,Cistel,"Really? 

I thought opposite. He was already thinking ""foul"" when they turned the ball over and I'm pretty sure the only thing he was thinking while charging at Caruso was to foul him somehow, someway. 

That thinking lead to this dangerous play. Watch the replay from when the Bucks turned it over, he tries to foul anyone in vicinity, starting off light (doesn't get called), the ball gets shifted to the other side of the court and he bring momentum into this foul. 

Just because his hands go near the ball doesn't make it at all a basketball play, especially if it's one with the mind of ""foul to stop them.""  That's an extremely dangerous mentality. This is compounded by his actions after already getting contact. If it was to foul, his first swing already accomplished that, the second one was pure intention to swing for no basketball reason

2022-01-22,MortalTwit,"Some people think he grabbed Caruso and dragged him to the ground.  I do not see that in the replay.  I see an idiot who made a play on the ball while coming in at a dangerous angle.  Got arm instead of ball, and whipped around with the other arm swatting at ball and got arm AGAIN. 

I do not see him grabbing and dragging - just swatting again like an idiot.

BUT, after getting the flagrant 2 and tossed, he was seen giggling.

THAT behavior can fuck right off.  Doesn't matter at all what else happened.  You hit a guy and made him land horrifically, and then also got tossed which hurts your team.

Potential serious injury?  Giggle.

Out of the game and hurts your team?  Giggle.

He's a fucking menace and frankly should not be in the league.  Back up to the 80's or god forbid the 90's, and his ass would have been dealt with by 280 pound 12th men enough times by now to know he cannot do that shit if he wants to keep his pretty face intact.

Instead, nothing of consequence ever happens, and he continues his long-standing pattern of dirty, dangerous plays and not giving a shit about them.

If I was another player in the league I would hate this guy, along with the Morris twins and any other goon who goes about trying to hurt people on purpose.  He endangers careers.
