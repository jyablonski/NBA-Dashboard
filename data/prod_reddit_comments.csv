I get the playstyles werent a perfect mesh, but if they would've kept shooters / pursued 3 and D guys, brought in a capable p&r big and run a Harden-centric offense, KD would get his efficient 30 in the flow of the game similarly to GS. KD isn't a system in himself, Harden is. (Not implying Harden is better than KD to avoid confusion). Kyrie is best as a complementary scorer alongside an elite playmaker who can also outscore him on any given night (like prime bron).  Obviously the big 3 together was the ideal case, but if I were given the choice to build around 2, it would've been KD and Harden.

I think peak Harden is a small step above peak Kobe offensively (36/7/8/2/1 on 44/37/88 vs 35/5/5/2/0 on 45/35/85), but Kobe is a much better defender. But I think each would be able to score on the other at will. 

Meanwhile peak Shaq vs peak Embiid is interesting. Embiid has the size of a classic “Shaq stopper,” which means peak Shaq would still score almost at will in the paint, but Embiid’s handle and deep shot make him much more dynamic on offense.

I'd probably have Turner 3 if I thought he could play more than 70 games in a season. JJJ might very well be the most impactful defender this season because of the time Draymond and Gobert have missed. Ayton, Mobley as well are up there. Obviously Brook Lopez historically.

2022-03-05,PeppaPig85210,">Beating good teams guarantees NOTHING.

yes and no. I'll give you the example of Miami vs Milwaukee the past couple years because I'm invested in it.

Miami in the 2020 season handled the Bucks convincingly in the regular season and figured a way to isolate Giannis and expose flaws in the Bucks offensive system that season. People brushed it aside and said Giannis is the MVP, DPOY, Milwaukee are the 1st seed blah blah blah, and then the Heat came up against the Bucks in round 2 and did the exact same thing and won in 5.

The next season, this time Milwaukee handled Miami pretty easily in the regular season, but people brushed it aside and said it doesn't mean anything until it happens in the playoffs, Jimmy owns Milwaukee, blah blah blah, and then Milwuakee did the same exact thing and swept Miami. 

While yes, beating good teams means nothing, it's really hard to just brush these games aside, as it's not like much is going to change between now and the playoffs. You have to realize these are the games that will be studied, analyzed and replicated to perfection by coaching staffs to prepare come playoff time.",Heat,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/t709ez/post_game_thread_the_milwaukee_bucks_3925_defeat/,0.4083,0.099,0.792,0.109

2022-03-05,victor396,"See it this way, have you ever read a comment or an article about a topic that you cared deeply about and it portrayed it in a bad way and, as far as you understand it, completely wrong one? Did it bumped you out a little bit? I'm not saying bother, just bumped. Or heard someone speaking mildly illly and unjustifily of a loved one at work? Again, it may not bother you, but it's going to have an effect.

Now imagine it in a 24/7 cycle. It starts lowing your a little bit. Then instead of a job with regular hours with a minor comment from a minor asshole it's a job where you don't see that person that much because he's constantly playing/working out/attending events and then it's a huge asshole he's leeching off of their career for a decade now. Sure, the pay is great, but see that constant, abrassive feelingweighting on you constantly.

Wouldn't you, in a moment you're particularly heated or don't have much patience, say something about it, even if generally you rationalize it pretty well and these kind of things don't bother you?

That's because Embiid is an elite offensive player.

It's because Stoudemire was better offensively than CP3's partner. CP3's partner could only dunk, so that's what CP3 fed. Stoudemire could drive, or he could hit the mid-range or he could pass the ball.

2022-03-05,Rhombinator,"I think Westbrook has been an easy target because he hasn't been performing well on the Lakers, isn't interested in taking a back seat and is taking up a loooot of cap space. People love to hate, and that's starting to spread a bit more to even LeBron since, per ""LeGM memes"" he probably had a say in the trade at the beginning of the season.

Personally, I don't think it's fair or right to just totally rag on a single player and let him take all the heat for the team being so bad. I think AD has a huge impact on the team and him being out due to injures has hurt the Lakers more (IIRC Westbrook generally looked better prior to AD being out for injuries? But I'm not historian).

Especially with the trade deadline drama, a lot of people are jumping on the Lakers hate bandwagon, which I think is all good and fun, but I think it's important to dump on the org and even the team rather than a single player.

It's why pretty much everyone I mentioned is an elite rim protector. Simmons is pretty much as high as you can go without being an elite rim protector.

He's not close to draymond or Gobert. And he has done zero to sperate himself from guys like Bam and Giannis who have shown that they can guard 2-5 and protect the rim in the playoffs. And it's not like Simmons is all that elite at guarding most 1s. He was still getting fairly regularly getting cooked by trae for instance last season.

I still think that a painful but competitive playoff loss will make the Bulls better next season. You just need more time together.

The fact is the NBA decided it wasn't a basketball move, which a lot of people with working eyes agreed with... Except the Bucks fans / org. Maybe there's some bias there? hmm 

You would be singing an entirely different tune if it was one of the Bucks you watched get injured in that manner, especially when you bring up Mike Dunleavy of all people in a series that had a lot of dirt going around.

2022-03-05,TeamDisrespect,I was just talking to my buddy about this.. the Sixers always intended for Butler to stay and basically had the payroll set up for a max contract slot that off season then Jimmy said he’d rather to to Miami which was a bit of a surprise.. so they had that max contract slot open and basically gave it to the next best guy they could find in Harris. It’s crazy when you realize Harris is the highest paid player on the court. But had Jimmy Butler decided to stay like almost everyone thought he would then you’d be looking at this team with him at that spot. Of course there’s always the butterfly effect of “if Jimmy stays maybe we go deeper in the playoffs last year and Ben doesn’t get butthurt so he doesn’t sit out this year and no Harden”.. but it is fun to think Harden Embiid Maxey Butler,76ers,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/t6zasl/tyrese_maxey_in_a_win_vs_the_cavaliers_3345_on/,0.7783,0.065,0.907,0.028

2022-03-05,CynicReaper,"GG.  Sixers are for real.  Couple of notes. 

DG was an absolute terror. The sixers were dialed in on him and still sliced them up 

Cavs played Embiid extremely well, gameplanned him really well. 

Maxey killed us with the attention harden and embiid got. 

Cavs lack of 3 balls outside of DG keeps hurting 

hardens passing game is fun but he still mocks basketball. 

Why we didn’t run more PNR with harden and embiid when we scored off it each time is confusing.  Something if im a sixer fan should keep an eye on. 

Effort was hard but simply sixers are better, doc River  is still mediocre.

2022-03-05,AustinRiversDaGod,"Here's a list of who I think are the most beloved Pelicans players in history excluding current players:

* Chris Paul
* Anthony Davis (pre-trade bitch ass actions)
* Jrue Holiday
* David West
* Demarcus Cousins (pre-free agency bitch ass actions)
* Peja Stojakavic
* PJ Brown
* Jannero Pargo
* Tyreke Evans
* David Wesley

2022-03-05,Steven81,"Same is true for basketball in the 80s. You would not see the same guy one million times on the line. There was always a leeway allowed, it is semi new thing to see guys routinely shooting 20 FTs a game.

Also according to current rules literally every trip down is a foul, either towards Giannis or *from* Giannis. So they clearly pick and choose already. There should be a balance between allowing a too rough game (that leads to injuries) and watching one extra hour of free throw shooting.

I am not the league I don't know where said balance is but it is certainly feels that we have gone all the way to other side from where we were when I first started watching (early 90s basically).

There is certainly a happy medium. And yes, basketball can be rough, as long as it does not lead to widespread injury we should be ok with allowing it.

2022-03-05,Eatingolivesoutofjar,"Simmons didn't play well but Maxey barely even played. Against the Hawks he was basically out of the rotation getting 5 minutes a game until game 6. His best playoff game ever is 16/7/1 on 40% shooting - a box score Ben would get clowned for.

We have 7 seasons of data proving Curry is by far the most valuable player on the team. Warriors still have the best defense rating in the league and even in the beginning of the season, the Warriors had a better defense rating in Curry lineups with NO Draymond. Offensively they go from top 10 to dog shit when Curry is off the floor. 

Curry still leads the league in net rating for players with 30+ min averages, even after the losing streaks. None of his teammates are close.

2022-03-05,MotoMkali,"See my other comments.

But basically dray and Gobert are 1 and 2 whatever order you like. But aside from that. Can you confidently say he's a better defender than Giannis, (a fit) AD, Myles Turner, (playoff) Embiid, JJJ, Bam hell even an Ayton.

Like Embiid has consistently been a top 3 defender in the playoffs since he's been fit - opponents socre 10 fewer pts per hundred when he's on the floor than when he isn't. Part of that is weak backup play but even adjusted for quality of his backups he's been like 1-3 in defensive pipm, raptor etc for a few seasons now in the playoffs. Ben probably hasn't even been the best defender on his own team until this season.

JJJ has been the most impactful defender in the league this season with Dray and Gobert missing so much time. He's been absolutely elite, been pretty much the best rim protector all season, and massively disruptive on the perimeter. 

Giannis and Brook Lopez led the bucks to the best playoff defence since the 04 pistons. And the 2nd best defence of the 21st century.

AD and Bam were the 2 best defenders in the bubble. And their defence was a major portion of why they went to the finals. Bams defence has also taken another step this year. Ayton did the same last playoffs.

Myles turner would pretty comfortably be number 3 in my opinion if he could stay fit. He's been like a +8 defender in the regular season like the last 5 seasons. Which is really fucking impressive when you consider like 2/3 of his minutes have come with Sabonis at the 4. Like he's a top 5 defence unto himself when playing with a bottom 20 defender in the league (at least when Sabonis is at the 4).

Then you have guys like Jrue, Smart and Bridges who are similar quality perimeter defenders overall but they do a much better job on 1s which is gernally the most impactful offensive position. Also Smart is just a much better team defender. Being able to organise a defence is an important skill which smart is elite at and Simmons isn't.

None of this denigrate Simmons. He's on par with all these guys I mentioned (except Turner but he's too injury prone) so he could be anywhere from 3-15. I'd probably have him 7th behind JJJ, Turner, Bam and Giannis on top of Gobert and Draymond.",Warriors,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/t70h4q/tyrese_maxey_has_officially_surpassed_ben_simmons/,0.9988,0.289,0.663,0.048

2022-03-05,Batmanhasgame,That is not even remotely true when you consider the fact that lonzo before going out was top 10 in the league in 3pt% while shooting high volume. Also the fact that lonzo and caruso if they don't get injured both make all defensive team this season. Those 2 alone are far more valuable than brook. Pat is still unrefined talent so I wont speak on him but lonzo an casuo mean far more to our team than brook does to yours. That is not taking anything away from brook but lonzo and carsuo literally had us top 5 in defense in the league and since they have been gone we are 30th.,Bulls,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/t709ez/post_game_thread_the_milwaukee_bucks_3925_defeat/,0.7149,0.104,0.869,0.027

2022-03-05,NextMention20,"I never directly said that Maxey was a a better playoff performer..Maxey was a rookie and aged 19 when he was drafted by the 76ers last year. By the time the playoffs rolled around, he was 20 and not as established yet. I don't think it is fair to compare a rookie Maxey to a Simmons, who already had 3 all star appearances by the time the 2021 playoffs rolled around. Of course Simmons should be held to a higher standard than Maxey, who was not near the player he is right now. Whereas Simmons has shown zero progression in his offensive skillset, despite this being his 5th season playing and 6th season total in the NBA. 

My main argument to the guy I responded to, is that Simmons had multiple playoff collapses. And I think heading forward, Maxey will be a better playoff performer, because he is already much more skilled than Simmons on offense, and isn't afraid to be aggressive towards defenses. We'll have to see how this plays out of course, but Maxey is showing signs of potential stardom.

1 and 2 are pretty clearly Gobert and Draymond. Doesn't matter what anyone else says but when they are fit they are the 2 best defenders in the league. But after them it's a free for all. Rim protection is the most valuable defensive skill and Simmons doesn't have it. That means You can very easily believe that in terms of defence Giannis, Bam, Turner, JJJ, Mobley, Lopez, AD, Embiid, Ayton are all as good or better defensively. Especially in the playoffs for guys like Giannis, AD and Embiid wjo seem to take it up a notch.

And in terms of perimeter defenders Jrue, Smart and Bridges I think are pretty comparable.

I'd probably have Simmons 7th? Gobert, Dray, Giannis, JJJ (probably had the most total defensive impact this year), Bam, Turner [I'd have him 3 if he could play a full season]. But you could have any of the guys I mentioned below Simmons or above him.

More people dislike the Lakers, for example, than like the Jazz. So, because of that, the front page ends up just being stuff that's positive about the teams with lots of fans and negative about the teams with lots of haters. You never see anything interesting about, like, the Magic.

Especially when Ben was literally dead cap space and would’ve been for the next 3 years had he not been traded.

They don’t give nearly as much of a shit about that as an organization compared to what you or I might as a fan.

If a team plays hard they should allow contact from the other team as well instead of constantly sending the same dude to the line, it's simply bad for the sport.
