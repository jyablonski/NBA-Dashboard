Every man for themselves basketball, and since the guards bring the ball up, the bigs are just left there to either suffer or hope that one day the guard allows them the privilege to touch the ball. As a big man that grew up in this environment these guys are incredibly annoying and made me wanna quit basketball.

In New York these days if you’re a guard you’re either a point god or you’re an inefficient chucker. No inbetween. Unfortunately wanting to be a point god is getting less and less common especially amongst elite players and most guards now just wanna get mine.

He played for The City AAU team with Eric Paschal. Unfortunately he was just better, longer, and more athletic than everyone else on the court so I’m sure his coaches encouraged his score-first attitude and no teammate had the equity to call him out.

Did the Mavs win? ✅ Damn good bounce back win after that blunder against Washington last game 

Glad after missing our first 2 freethrows, we went on to make 22 of our 23 next freethrows 🎗️

Luka 32/8/15 with 3 Steals. Best thing about today was he went 11/14 from the FT Line 🔥🇸🇮🎗️

Brunson Burner with a solid 15/3/1 with 3 3's ♨️

Dwight was arguably the MVP of the game. 22/13 and went 8/10 from the field against an MVP like Giannis and doing all the little things to force turnovers and flip possessions. 🔥7️⃣🏀

R3GGI3 with 16/7 knocking down 3 3's 👌💦

Spence with a quiet yet solid 11pts tonight all off of 3/4 on 3's & 2/2 FT's🪙👌💤

Doe Doe with 11/1/6 & 2 Steals 🦤

2022-04-04,rake2204,">Since Nike took over, the uniform concepts mean nothing anymore. It might be just my preference, but I like having some sort of order to jersey-wearing for the teams.

This bothers me way more than it should. 

Basketball is unique from many other sports because on-court and in-arena branding is so strong that all a home team needs to do is complement the surrounding schemes (a white home jersey with a solid portion of team color suits this perfectly).

In contrast, a road basketball team only has one shot at branding and identity and that's through their uniform. They don't have helmets and different colored pants like football and hockey and they don't have a chance to rock their colors on their hat like baseball teams do. 

As a result, every single time a road team rolls into an opposing arena wearing their whites, it's like they've been stripped of their identity, while the home team basks in color overkill (jerseys, shorts, paint, sidelines, dorna boards, basket stanchions, cheerleaders). 

The least we could do for road teams (and for overall aesthetic) is to bring back the road darks. 

I'm all in on returning to a form of jersey standardization (four unis - home, away, special retro, special alt) that are worn at semi-predictable times and occasions.",Pistons,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tvs9gq/the_aesthetics_of_the_nba_have_gone_downhill/,0.9711,0.121,0.849,0.031

They have reason to be regretful first and foremost because of Kobe’s untimely passing away, but also because they left a lot on the table as a product of the upside that their combined, complementary skill sets.

By comparison, I’m confident—perhaps overly so— that Shaq and Kobe is just as good as MJ and Pippen in terms of sheer dominance.

Neither Mitchell nor Gobert are comparable. I’m not trying to be contrarian or a dick, and if I’m coming off as such, I apologize.

2022-04-04,cheap_chalee,"I remember reading an opinion piece near the end of his tenure at OKC about his relationship with the media. The article talked about how being a star player in OKC compared to a bigger market is a different experience and they are more ""coddled"" so to speak (that was the verbage used in the article, not me) and how it's easier to get away with certain things that you wouldn't be in a bigger market (I think that even included declining to speak to the media if desired). 

So it's possible that maybe his relationship with the media has always been frosty except now that he's in LA, everything is a bigger deal or more scrutinized. Although having the worst season of your career also no doubt has to have some effect on his interaction as well.

But I do remember one time where he very blatantly voiced his displeasure with a specific member of the OKC media to that person's face. He said something to the effect of, ""I don't have a problem with the media. I have a problem with you."" It is/was on YouTube.

Despite that he only shot 5 shots that game and to his credit he made them all but a more dominate center would've attempted a lot more shots so either Gobert is also hated by his national team or they know that Gobert isn't a consistently reliable scoring threat and didn't bother running to many plays for him.",Timberwolves,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tvdrz0/dustin_taylor_heres_a_fun_stat_donovan_averages_2/,0.5184,0.123,0.782,0.094

We LOVE watching it because every foul is more proof of how unstoppable Embiid is under the rim.

Running back tape, he should actually get more calls than he does. He just doesn’t because it would enrage everyone even more if they called every time he got smacked in the arms under the rim.

There was a video from a Knicks game earlier in the season counting the legitimacy of his 20+ FTs that game and only 1 or 2 calls were borderline. That video is not an outlier.

Yes, he baits fouls as a strategy, but at this point blind hate influences people’s opinions over actually looking at each foul.

For every 1-2 bad calls Embiid still gets legitimately fouled another 8 times, plus 1-2 that should’ve been called and people complain as if every FT is fraudulent.

That said…

- Horrible defensive performance tonight by the Raptors, especially in the second half; they looked disjointed and consistently one step behind. (Though I will say of the few Heat games I’ve seen this season their offence never looked as smooth as it did tonight, wonder if Jimmy sitting out had anything to do with that)

- We were riding on Fred’s red hot 17pt performance in the 1Q, and when we started missing shots we didn’t adjust well.

- Fred & Pascal were good, but not great and nobody else really stepped up to the plate tonight.

- Boucher in particular chose a bad game to have an off night, 3 of 10 from the field isn’t great.

- Tonight has to have been our season high for FTA, we *never* get that many calls.

- Our defence once again looks considerably worse without OG on the floor, a few games can be considered outliers but this has happened enough to warrant being labelled a trend.

- Why we are still starting Khem Birch at this point is beyond me, even with OG out I would have given the starting spot to Precious.

All in all, not a great performance tonight from the Raptors, but not exactly “bad” either, and definitely not the worst I’ve seen this season.

TLDR on how to beat the Raptors: Pass to the open man, hit your threes and stick to zone defence.

This would have to be a long process. You wouldn't be able to issue a gun ban and then have them all collected in the short term. 

Phase it starting with volunteer relinquishing by offering cash rebates, tax credits, that sort of thing. Entice people to participate because after that phase, there won't be a personal incentive. 

In the next phase you start with rules that will tighten over time. At the beginning of this phase if found to own a now illegal firearm the firearm is only confiscated. By the end of the phase you could face jail or fines. 

Eventually you will have phased out guns from public. No doubt you will still have people that safeguard firearms, but if they are locked away and never brought into public it is effectively the same as not having any guns.

i don't know why i need to refute it. the guy you replied to said ""Jokic is more efficient as a scorer than all of KD's seasons except last (where he only played 35 games) on only slightly lower volume, while being vastly better at all the non-scoring aspects of offense.""

that's just facts. jokic is sitting on a 66.2 TS% rn and kd really does have only one season better than that. and jokic is clearly a waaaay better playmaker than kd. what's your rebuttal meant to be, that kd takes harder shots? that's his choice, isn't it? if you want to tell that kd has a deeper 'bag' or that he's better at shooting from 3 or whatever, then yes, i agree. but what matters is scoring a lot and scoring a lot on as few shots as possible. and jokic is currently outperforming kd on that front",Spurs,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tvlgfk/nikola_jokic_vs_the_lakers_38_pts_18_rebs_6_asts/,0.9284,0.135,0.84,0.025

First, let’s just preface this by saying Luke Walton was god awful. The players hated him and made consistently terrible moves late in games. 

Second, Buddy Hield. Dude is pretty clearly the second best three point shooter in the league (shooting 40 percent on 11 attempts) like what the fuck. That is insanity. If they figure out how to utilize that weapon correctly, something Walton seemed to suck at, that’s league breaking numbers, reminds me of mark jackson warrior shit, watch out.

Third, Marvin Bagley, another Walton enemy. IMO dude might be one of the most underrated players in league. His first 3 years in  the league averaged 14 and 8 on like 55 percent TS in 25 min. That’s pretty fucking elite. Tonight Lakers had no answer for him and fox in the pick and roll with Hield waiting to pull up.

Fox, Hield, Halli, Barnes, Holmes, Bagley, Mitchell, TT, metu. Don’t count them out to make a huge run.",NA,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tvrz4l/the_sacramento_kings_have_been_eliminated_from/,-0.8271,0.118,0.733,0.149

He doesn't have much of an offensive game outside of \~6 feet so it's not that shocking that he doesn't see the ball in the frontcourt unless it's finishing off a pass for a FGA, rebounding, or executing a dribble handoff.

Edit: Like for reference I would compare him to someone like Clint Capela... and unsurprisingly they're roughly equal in front court touches per game. Gobert also is 2nd in paint touches per game amongst centers. 

20 frontcourt touches per game minus 11 paint touches per game leaves 9 other frontcourt touches.

2022-04-04,Carolake1,"First of all, you completely misused or misunderstood the terminology here. If you want to measure the effectiveness of lineups, you *want* Mitchell on, Others off to be played against **random** lineups. Instead, what happens is the coach *decides* when to play that lineup, presumably picking it against defenses where he thinks it will be effective. This causes a potential problem for understanding this stat. Does it measure Mitchell's effectiveness, or does it measure the lineups the coach chooses him to face? Bottom line is you can't tell.

Second, why do you think it matters if it is *a lot* of minutes? The key issue here is that the coach uses information we don't observe here in deciding when to play the lineups. Bench lineups, for example, play a lot of minutes. Garbage time adds up to a lot of minutes over a season. Certain types of defenses add up to lots of minutes. The coach could be deciding to play without Gobert and Conley in situations where they aren't really needed. This could add up to many minutes over a season.

His 3 is shot but I don't think that that's the primary reason he made the adjustment. A guy who consistently volume shoots at 65-70% rate from inside should be crazy to be shooting even one three. Unless he somehow manages to shoot them at over 43%-45%.

I think that's the actual reason why Jokic stopped. The 3 is not a good shot for him even if he was shooting at 40% rate.

He is *now* a better scorer because he realized that 3s are a trash shot for an inside scorer of his calliber.

when you break it down like that i feel like it does show Mitchell is reluctant to pass to Gobert to the point he's treating him like a backup guy. but i'd have to look at other similar situations around the league to confirm that these numbers are actually an anomaly.",76ers,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tvdrz0/dustin_taylor_heres_a_fun_stat_donovan_averages_2/,0.9178,0.131,0.85,0.02

Sabonis is great but I think his only ""true"" all-star berth was in 2019-20 when he had a great supporting cast.

Injuries and cancer screwed over the team in 2020-21 but I think he'll be fine next year assuming Sacramento gives him a decent cast as even though the Pacers got fucked by injuries again this year, there was more than enough games of Brogdon/LeVert/Sabonis that probably convinced FO to move them.",bwInd,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tvrz4l/the_sacramento_kings_have_been_eliminated_from/,0.6271,0.177,0.704,0.119

Are there bad city uniforms? Yeah, of course. But I respect trying something different, something more tethered to the city.

So the idea of making uniforms more tailored to the city than to the team is actually a cool one. And we've gotten some absolute bangers out of it.

2022-04-04,sydchefcurry,"> Though I will say of the few Heat games I’ve seen this season their offence never looked as smooth as it did tonight, wonder if Jimmy sitting out had anything to do with that

Spo rejigged the rotations and offense after the 0-4 week to focus more on the 4 best players first, instead of on getting role players going as a priority. Since that week, Spo has gotten Jimmy to play off the catch at the free throw line a bit more, and there's more Lowry/ Bam pick and roll as the bread and butter, so it's probably a very different offense to the HURDUR JIMMY ISOLATION you saw for a stretch mid-season.",Heat,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tvpta1/post_game_thread_the_miami_heat_5128_defeat_the/,0.3676,0.084,0.836,0.08

2022-04-04,OkAutopilot,"Melo played 7 1/2 seasons in a Nuggets uniform before being traded to the Knicks for grand totals of 14k/3.6k/1.7k/600/260 in 20k minutes. 

Jokic is about to wrap up his 7th season for grand totals of 10k/5.4k/3.3k/600/370 in 16k minutes (and only 40 less games played in).

Melo came into a team that was playoff ready with the Nuggets, played way worse every year in all but one postseason for splits of 24/6/3/1 on 52/34/82 shooting, and lost in the first round all but 1 year. That's 45 playoff games as a Denver Nugget, for a record of 16-30.

Jokic came into a team that was rebuilding and he didn't even start right away, then when they were playoff ready they were the youngest team overall to ever get to the playoffs (I believe or perhaps the youngest to reach the conference finals the next year), and have not lost in the first round since. Instead of playing worse in the playoffs like Carmelo, Jokic improved his play each year in the postseason for splits of 26/11/6/1/1 on 51/41/84. He has played in 43 playoff games as a Denver Nugget for a grand total of 20-23.

There isn't anything to be said about longevity as Melo only played 40 more games as a Nugget. There isn't anything to say about the playoffs because Jokic has already surpassed Melo's totals, averages, and wins in the playoffs.

2022-04-04,InexorableWaffle,"Yeah, I think it's safe to say at this point. Giannis may make it interesting the last couple games, but ultimately, his MVP case hinged on us taking the 1st seed and Denver falling into the play-ins. Our loss earlier basically eliminates the former as a possibility, and Denver winning basically eliminates the latter as well (I know neither is mathematically guaranteed, but they're both probable enough at this point that I don't think it's worth thinking there's a chance either of those changes in the last few games of the season.

2022-04-04,QCash0723,"Lakers - Spurs ended as a 2-2, so tiebreaker goes to second ruling which is based off of Conference record. The Spurs have a 22-25 record in Western team matchups while the Lakers have a 16-32 record against teams in their own conference. If the Spurs beat Portland tonight (making the Spurs 33-45, they're currently up 72-66) the likeliness of the Lakers making the play-in is very unlikely. It would require the Lakers to either go 3-1 or 4-0 in their last 4 games on schedule (Suns, Warriors, Thunder, Nuggets) while needing the Spurs (who have Nuggets, Timberwolves, Warriors, Mavericks left) to go 1-3 (again if the Spurs win tonight; Lakers going 4-0 in last 4 games) or 0-4 (Lakers going 3-1).

2022-04-04,Julian_Caesar,"> So NRA right wing talking heads just bring up mental health when notable mass shootings occur cause they care about suicide? 

Ask actual gun owners what they think about the NRA. Most will tell you that the NRA cares more about ammo sales than the second amendment.

>I could care less about an opinion article on guns on fivethirtyeight btw

Not an opinion article. Facts article. Mass shootings are a bad way to understand gun violence. Period. End of story.

>Especially if it’s in favor of not making changes to decrease the amount of mass shootings in this country in general.

Tell me you didn't read the article at all, without telling me you didn't read the article at all. How big brain of you to sharply criticize a collection of facts that you didn't bother reading.

>We’re just going to keep acting like it’s okay that children in schools are gonna have to learn how to deal with active shooter threats like it’s normal life.

School shootings are decreasing. Not increasing. You gonna tell me that The Intercept is too conservative of a source?

2022-04-04,whostheme,"It's arguably more dangerous if he drives into the center of the lane like that. A superstar PG is at his best when he's at that specific point in the paint since he can dish it out a pass from the best angle possible. Steve Nash was notorious for abusing this tactic back in the day.

If he drives and gets to the rim

1. Pass from the best angle on the whole floor

2. Draw a foul

3. Go for a layup or dunks

4. Draw in 2-3 defenders and react accordingly on what he should do then


If he doesn't drive and Giannis is blocking his entryway for the drive he has less options

1. Pass to teammate from a harder angle outside the 3 point line

2. Pump fake maybe draw a foul (very unlikely)

3. Shoot a tough stepback 3",Spurs,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tvgvw1/highlight_luka_dances_and_creates_separation_to/,-0.3597,0.103,0.766,0.131

2022-04-04,Rykno23,"Yeah, I mean, I basically said that, more to blame than fox. Organization is bad from top to bottom. Like, they were never going to get the most out of Hali and Fox together, at best you have two decent PGs despite no great talent at other positions. Doubled down on it and drafted ANOTHER guard, just puzzling moves if they really believed in their roster. 

Now, imo, since they’ve already kind of observed that Fox wasn’t really moving the needle, they should’ve kept Hali. As you said, they still lost with Hali, but I think in order for a team to be good, players gotta know their role and be comfortable in it, and they’d probably be better going forward with Hali truly in the point guard role and not just games with Fox out or on the bench.  

So yeah, they have a lot of problems, but I think doubling down on Fox by trading Hali was a short sighted move as a result of them looking for solutions that Fox/Sabonis probably won’t provide",Rockets,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tvrz4l/the_sacramento_kings_have_been_eliminated_from/,0.9515,0.155,0.778,0.067

2022-04-04,OkAutopilot,"Because Marcus Camby only played in 600 minutes of that season as opposed to starting in Melo's rookie year and they brought in Andre Miller to be the point guard. Two gigantic changes. Not to mention a few other roster changes to jettison bad players and bring in quality contributors. Andre Miller and Camby were equally if not greater reasons for the teams success than Melo was those first two years. 

I don't think Melo forced his way out of Denver either. He said he didn't want to be on a tanking/rebuilding team, the Nuggets said ""well we're shipping Chauncey out and not adding anything, we need a rebuild here sorta"", and Melo was like no man I am in my prime I want to play in the playoffs. So he got out. 

So I'm not undervaluing or hating on Melo for that. The completely honest truth is that Melo is an extremely overrated player and played very bad in the playoffs. That's not hate. That's coming from as objective of a place as possible. Feel free to go watch most of those series that he/we kept getting swept in the first round over, and over, and over, and over in. 

He played iso hero ball, bad defense, never made anyone around him better, and had terrible decision making and shot selection that just got worse in the postseason somehow. 

On top of that Karl was a coach that made lousy adjustments and played in a system that was okay but was clearly having a wrench thrown in it by Melo's ball-stopping, and he just kept preaching the system and trying to get Melo to buy into it instead of realizing he wasn't going to. 

Melo on the Nuggets was a 6'8"" Damian Lillard without the leadership, without the passing, without the willingness to differ, and without a consistent 3pt shot. 

I'm thankful for getting to see postseason play after the Nuggets had been a trash can for the entirety of the 90s and early 2000s, but he was truly someone who played textbook losing basketball.",Nuggets,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tvlgfk/nikola_jokic_vs_the_lakers_38_pts_18_rebs_6_asts/,0.9747,0.142,0.794,0.064

It generates 6 more play off games, which is essentially a full extra series of games each year which is profitable for the league. It also reduces tanking to some extent, as some teams are willing to push for a play in spot regardless of the first round exit it will likely lead to. The wider net of teams pushing for the playoffs leads to a larger amount of late season games where there aren’t teams obviously tanking/resting, increasing viewership.

2022-04-04,OkAutopilot,"I know it was. He was 2nd to Marc Gasol. Absolutely fantastic season. His defense was great, but again, he was operating above a big safety net that allowed that defense to shine at it's fullest.

I'm not arguing for Jokic to be the DPOY but he's anchoring the Nuggets to a slightly above average defense that is rolling out one of the worst defensive guard tandems in the league in Morris and Barton, and the starting ""big"" next to him most nights is Jeff Green. Not exactly an excellent defender himself. 

Not to mention the bench players who come in to play with him in Bones rookie, poor defender), Forbes (disastrous defender), JaMyke (very solid or very bad), and a plus defender in Reed.  

He's leading all bigs in forced turnovers and, while I present this with a huge grain of salt because defensive catchalls are pretty iffy, his DBPM this year is almost double that of LeBron's in 2013. 

Jokic's defense, while he isn't the DPOY, is immeasurably better than most people realize, and his impact on offense this year is obviously a notch above LeBron's in 2013. 

So, like I said, it is absolutely in that realm of all-time level play. FWIW he currently has the best season of all time by essentially every catchall/advanced stat.

2022-04-04,OkAutopilot,"That is exactly what didn't happen. What you're saying is the wildly and incorrectly perpetuated rumor/narrative. Like tabloid gossip rumor repeating essentially by salty Nuggets fans.

Following the WCF season we got rid of Dahntay Jones who was a gigantic piece to that team. Key piece. They didn't retool or reload after that either. Then you look at the season in question (2011) K-Mart, J.R., Camby, were all going to be gone as they were expiring. Chauncey too if the option was declined which it was an open secret the Nuggets were likely not going to re-sign him/keep him on. 

The Nuggets made a point, Ujiri literally told him, that they wanted to go younger. Melo said he didn't want to be part of a rebuilding process and he engaged with them saying he doesn't want to be part of that. They said okay, and they moved him. The Knicks were not even the only team he said he'd accept a trade to, but preferred a trade there because they were one of the only teams with the assets to trade for him that could also put out a winning team due to there being an inherent NYK draw, in theory, and Amar'e was already there who was his buddy. His wife too maybe.

But Carmelo more famous? How silly. That guy is not exactly a media starved player and never was. He does not put himself out there for ""fame"", he isn't a super attention craved or marketed dude, so that's just a weird thing to say. Obviously complete conjecture but still, weird. 

So there you have it. That's really what happened with the Nuggets. I remember it then, and now that he, and front office people form the Nuggets at that time, and other GMs, and players have talked about it since then, you get the real story instead of ""Carmelo demanded a trade from the Nuggets, who totally weren't about to try to rebuild if he stayed, because he wanted to be a celebrity"" or whatever that is.",Nuggets,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tvlgfk/nikola_jokic_vs_the_lakers_38_pts_18_rebs_6_asts/,0.5993,0.054,0.902,0.043

There's three big reasons for this:

1) The newer logos are easier to read on a mobile phone screen, and especially when in a state of low attention. This is advantageous as your logo's main job is to be noticed and recognised, and if people are increasingly consuming content mindlessly on their phones, then the logo needs to change to cater to that 

2) If you look at those new logos they are very consistent. This means that they can be applied for all kinds of new sub-brands and product lines. People will easily link that new product from the NBA to the NBA because its brands look similar. Consistency is very fashionable at the moment, partly because it is pretty effective at linking your new product to all that stored up goodwill you have for its parent brand (i.e. oo Jimmy Butler has a new coffee line), and also because a lot of companies are under pressure to show growth to their investors, but have pretty much got what they are going to get from the mature market they're originally from - forcing them to try out new product lines. A good example here is how NBA and soccer teams are dipping their toe in the water with e-sports. 

3) It's fashionable in branding circles because tech companies do it, and everyone, even if their company is nothing like a tech company, wants to feel that tech company 'cool' status.

**In short, the new logos are shit and boring, but are actually more effective at their job of making you remember the NBA / the NBA finals.**",Kings,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tvs9gq/the_aesthetics_of_the_nba_have_gone_downhill/,0.9124,0.081,0.878,0.041

Yeah, no. Alcohol kills 95k people every year, most of them NOT overdoses. Vast majority are addicts that killed themselves over time, ruined half their families, beat their spouses and kids, and generally made society a worse place.

You're beyond naive if you think legalization of dangerous drugs makes them less dangerous. Sure you can decrease the overdose rate, but there's a lot more harm that can be done than just overdosing. Not to mention that, as bad as the alcohol stats are, cocaine and heroin are WAYYYYY more addictive than alcohol.

And before anyone asks, of course im not talking about weed. No one dies from weed overdose so its not even counted in those previous stats. legalizing weed is not without some harms but its a totally different conversation and not even the same stratosphere as alcohol, heroin, cocaine, etc.

Um...you do realize that the Nazis rose to power through political means, right? And that they used these means *specifically because they failed to take power through violence*, right?

>(although both may be unlikely). 

Of course they're both unlikely. That's not the question. The question is, would striking down the second amendment make Americans more or less susceptible to armed oppression?

What I mean by this, is that not a single gun has ever brought someone a good time without bringing someone else a bad time. And you're right; that's why tanks aren't available to the public. Thank you for making that point *for* me.

2. I'm saying that 100k that opt into the danger of taking drugs to feel good, is a far cry from the 50k that don't opt in to getting killed at all.

You understand the difference between ""something that's designed to harm others"" vs ""something that's designed to have a good time"", right?

2022-04-04,annoyinconquerer,"Jokic certainly should get more calls than he does, but the way he scores a lot of the time is way more finesse and trickery, to the point where he completely avoids contact from being so good at his sloppy fat boy awkward shot skills.

If you listen to Embiid on JJ Redick’s latest podcast, he outright says that he makes sure he gets the ref’s attention every single time he’s smacked and it’s not called, then goes down the next possession and does the same exact thing so they can’t no-call him twice in a row. It is deliberate and it shows in the amount of attempts he gets. He’s literally not gonna stop this method unless the rules change, especially considering how much drawing fouls puts pressure on the defense and puts the Sixers closer to the bonus.

Jokic is way more humble about no calls aside from the few times he does rage out at the refs, which has happened a few times this year. Embiid is literally not ashamed of playing chess while others are willingly playing checkers. Playing with Harden who has the same approach just makes this more infuriating to people.

Giannis does actually get about as many calls as Joel, mostly from dribble drives though. I probably hate his shoulder charges being called as a block as much as people hate Embiid’s foul baiting.",76ers,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tvoiux/joel_embiid_today_44_points_17_rebounds_5_blocks/,-0.9518,0.101,0.741,0.159

2022-04-04,CocoDreamboat,"So devil's advocate here a bit - the Jazz stagger their minutes for most of the game, so despite them both playing 30+ minutes they usually start and end games together but otherwise split time. That's why he passes to Whiteside almost as much as he passes to Gobert.

That being said, even if they only played 10 minutes together he's got to look to pass inside more. He only either swings the ball on the wings or drives and passes back out to the wings. He is absolutely not looking to pass the ball to the roll man in P&R and/or when Gobert has space in the paint, and the offense gets stagnant as a result. It's less noticeable most of his minutes because Gobert's usually not on the floor with him which means Mitchell and Clarkson *should* be the ones shooting.

The other side of this is when Gobert does get the ball down low it's not nearly as successful as it should be. He turns it over, misses, or panics and passes it back out way more than he should, so it would be hard to trust him at the same time.",Jazz,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tvdrz0/dustin_taylor_heres_a_fun_stat_donovan_averages_2/,-0.8318,0.036,0.876,0.088

2022-04-04,Downunderphilosopher,"Bottom 5 coach I explained in another comment.

   Bottom 5 overpaid star is true for this season based on Harden's shooting splits, he is almost unplayable in half the games when he just Isos and dribbles the air out of the ball, only to shoot a 3 that's falling at 30% or drive and throw up his arms in frustration at a foul that isn't there. Harden really is that bad in many of the games so far, he is basically good against weak defenses and atrocious against good ones. In those games it would be better to play pretty much anyone who could just defer to Embiid and spread the floor. The hope is it's just his hammy and he will bounce back next year, but this year is not good.

  Bottom 5 bench, it's arguable they could play better with a new coach, but there really isn't much scoring or defense there regardless. Danny has lost a lot, DJ is a joke and has no lift or BB IQ, Kork is shooting career worst splits and is unplayable right now. Shake still isn't over his injuries and can't do much either.

Drawing fouls is a strategy in the highest tier of competition, and should be respected as that.

If your goal is to lock up a player on an island, he’s not elite. If your goal is to prevent the other team from scoring, he’s DPOY caliber and it’s not even arguable. I can provide context for how he does it, but a bbref dive can confirm this without a doubt. Literally pick any defensive stat and he’s top 5.

2022-04-04,Father-John-Moist,"Defensive stats are tough and I agree that they can be misleading. But what about when every defensive stat favors one player? That’s significant right?

Watching Jokic, what you’ll see is that he puts players off balance before the shot and has incredibly disruptive hands. He doesn’t block shots at an elite clip, but the work is done before the shot even goes up. 

Not to mention the steals and less noticed is the baits. 

Earlier this week a stat came out about Pat Beverly’s effect on Luka. He prevents Luka from scoring and makes him shoot at a significantly lower efficiency. What wasn’t mentioned is that Luka’s team scores significantly more points with pat bev guarding Luka. So any coach would rather let Luka cook while the Mavs struggle right?

Defensive stats in a vacuum are kinda iffy. 
Jokic has currently a defensive box plus minus of 4,5. That would put him at fifth all time. 

It also depends on the roster construction and defensive scheme.

2022-04-04,teb311,"Jazz fan here: we miss out on 3-4 “easy bucket” attempts per game because only Conley can hit Gobert down low on a mismatch, or while rolling. Ingles was able to as well, but Mitchell and Clarkson both can’t or don’t make those passes consistently. Gobert shares some blame, he fumbles tougher passes sometimes, especially bounce passes. Plus, his post game is kinda weak, so if you don’t hit him for a no-dribble play it might be a turnover instead.

Still, it’s a problem. Mitchell ought to hit Gobert more like 4-6 times a game and 80% of them would be assists if Mitchell just seized the existing opportunities. It’s especially bad in the 4th because teams know Mitchell won’t make the pass, so they commit hard to defending him knowing full well he is trying to create his own shot. 

Coaching shares some blame too. We have gone up 20 points by playing team basketball only to lose it in the 4th something like 20 times this season. We should be running the offense through Conley late in the 4th instead of continuing to let Don run low efficiency isos.

This is even without the discussion that since he was in Houston he was the primary scorer, while on Nets and sixers both Durant, Irving and Embiid are primary scorers so Harden is turning more PG plays and assists.

2022-04-04,OkAutopilot,"I don't think it's a stretch. I don't know that outside of 09 that LeBron has had a season as good/impactful as Jokic is having this year. Certainly all the statistical models suggest the same thing, but I think the eye test is enough on that. It's just going to take some getting used to for people to accept/believe that.

What LeBron did on those first stint Cavs teams and the level of responsibility he had to carry that team is the closest parallel we have in the history of the NBA to what Jokic is doing right now. 

Also the ""DPOY caliber"" LeBron stuff is overblown. He was not playing that level of defense every night consistently on the Cavs, even when he was capable of being the DPOY if he chose to do that. Similarly to how Kobe played elite defense when he was called to do so or locked in, but that was not the focus and intensity every night. When he got to Miami he was playing unbelievable defense, but he was also playing on a team full of incredible defensive players and an amazing scheme. There was a huge safety net for him, even bigger than the one Giannis has with a healthy Bucks team.

I'm pretty confident when we're not in the moment, down the road when people are looking back at this or maybe even in a few years time, it will be more widely accepted and understood that we're looking at a top 5, all time, individual stretch of seasons here.",Nuggets,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tvlgfk/nikola_jokic_vs_the_lakers_38_pts_18_rebs_6_asts/,0.9902,0.164,0.816,0.02

Basketball is team game

>	That’s the entire point. He’s not a versatile defender. If you pull him away from the rim, he is a liability.

Except he’s the #1 isolation defender in the league. Go ahead and do your googling I’ll wait

>	They tried against the Clippers and he couldn’t score on forwards.

No they didn’t

>	Why keep forcing the issue when it’s not working? 

They didn’t

>	Going small is supposed to have disadvantages, but Rudy can’t create his own shot against smaller guys.

Correct. You’ve got to create it for him and he’s got to play positionally and utilize his size. You know, like he does better than anyone since Akeem on the defensive side of things. Clearly he’s got the tools. 

>	GSW showed the blueprint four years ago and everyone has done the exact same thing to knock the Jazz out every single year.

No. The Rockets showed the blueprint first. Get your timeline straight at the VERY least if you’re actually going to act like you know more than people who know the Jazz inside and out. 

>	Y’all just making up a new reality to defend Rudy?

No. It’s clarifying the reality of things to nephews who inaccurately narrate these things. It’s to try and help your white hot, trash takes. I’m here to help you understand how wrong you are.

To someone like you who doesn't understand it, sure.

>You realise the purpose of a gun is to cause harm to someone else, and the purpose of drugs is to enjoy yourself?

Yes, and thank for bringing this up! A substance designed to enjoy yourself is twice as likely to kill you in America as a machine designed specifically to kill you...not a good look.

I mean, you *do* really care about people dying, right? You're not just making this argument to defend your political tribe, right? You *do* really just want to help the greatest number of people, right?

>Also, a huge problem with drugs is overdosing. Something you can help prevent by legalisation (or at least condoning and offering testing). There's exceptions, obviously, and some drugs need to stay illegal. There's a very clear line.

So you're saying that legislation for drugs should carefully balance benefits with risks? Great idea. Let's do the same with guns. That way, you can abolish guns just as soon as you prove that there is no possible benefit to owning a gun.

Spurs are 5-1 ATS in their last 6 games overall San Antonio's balanced offense was led by Devin Vassell's 22 points and Keldon Johnson's 21 points in the Spurs' fifth win in six games on Friday. By halftime, San Antonio had built a 25-point advantage against Portland, and the Spurs had strolled to victory. Zach Collins scored 15 points, Joshua Primo and Jakob Poeltl each had 13 points, and Josh Richardson and Lonnie Walker IV each had 12 points.

Portland (27-50) was eliminated from playoff contention with the loss, which was the team's sixth in a row and 16th in its last 18 games. Trail Blazers are 1-5 ATS in their last 6 games overall. Keon Johnson led eight Trail Blazers in double figures scoring with 21 points. For Portland, Brandon Williams had 16 points, Greg Brown III and Drew Eubanks each had 13, and Ben McLemore and Kris Dunn each had 12.

Five games left for the Trail Blazers. If they win just one game, they will have the NBA's sixth-worst record and are almost certain to be drafted high.

I'm talking about AMERICA banning guns. This issue isn't Cali only.

As for people getting guns elsewhere; simple fact of availability. You ban guns, there will be fewer in your country, and thus fewer gun deaths. You tackle the issue of imported guns in other ways.

You can ""not believe"" that all you want, but the stats in other parts of the world show that it's true.

The sad thing is that so many people say ""take away all the guns it'll prevent mass shootings"" then turn right around and say ""we have to legalize drug use because people will use drugs anyway."" Yes, the other side is often equally hypocritical, i know (except the libertarians, who are crazy in other ways but consistent on liberty issues).

Pick one side. Be consistent. Guns and drugs both kill people...and only one of them can be used to resist oppressive governments (yes, even against advanced militaries...ask Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Vietnam if you need nuclear weapons to outfight a ""superior"" military).

2022-04-04,Julian_Caesar,"This is true about Reddit, as well as many other online spaces. At times i felt like I was the only sane voice in a sea of unproductive anger, when it came to things like ""we shouldn't give ICU beds to unvaccinated covid patients."" As Jon stewart said, if you abandon principles in a crisis, you don't have principles, you have hobbies. Even r/medicine gave into this groupthink at times (though i think we are more forgivable on that point since we were being spit on by unvaccinated patients and blamed for their deaths despite days of round the clock ICU care).

It is also true that unvaccination >>>> vaccination in terms of ""risk to self."" And some risk to others. Given the relative risks of vaccination going ""bad"" versus the risk of dying from covid (or simply the increased likelihood of being a reservoir for mutations/spread in general), not getting vaccinated reveals a very poor risk analysis. Aside from a very small population that can't get it for medical reasons.

On one side, not a single person has died *because of* a covid vaccine in the US: https://www.bbc.com/news/health-60653946

On the other side, over 200k people died *because of* non-adherence to vaccination recommendations. Mostly the unvaccinated themselves: https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/covid19-and-other-leading-causes-of-death-in-the-us/

The ""better"" is specifically what we're debating so that's not really saying anything, and pointing out efficiency is ignoring the context that offense as a whole is more efficient.  Kyrie is also more efficient than Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan if we choose to ignore they played with different defensive rulesets and were asked to shoot mostly long twos, often fading away.  That also happens to be a significant chunk of what AI was asked to do.

AI was inefficient for his era even in early 2000s standards. Below 53 TS% is unacceptable as a superstar and I don't care what era. Also people love to act like he carried that team while he had a solid supporting cast with a 6MOY in McKie, DPOY in Mutombo, and CoTY in Larry Brown.

>....I hold there is neither warrant, license, nor sanction of the hateful thing; but, interpreted as it ought to be interpreted, the Constitution is a GLORIOUS LIBERTY DOCUMENT.

While I do not intend to argue this question on the present occasion, let me ask, if it be not somewhat singular that, if the Constitution were intended to be, by its framers and adopters, a slave-holding instrument, why neither slavery, slaveholding, nor slave can anywhere be found in it.

I'm sure the black people in low income neighborhoods really want your white knight arguments under their pillow rather than a gun, when police response time is 20+ minutes.

I'm sure the Black Panthers in California who were targeted by Reagan in the 60's with the Mulford Act were all in favor of second amendment abolition.

Even more so in the case. First, the game of basketball is not played on a spreadsheet. Second, the other guys score more. Get the foul line more and have wayyy better defense(all stats).

Getting the other team in foul trouble is probably one of the best things you can do to help your team win games.
