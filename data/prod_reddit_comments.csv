Yes they worked extremely hard to get where they are, but the fact that Westbrook will be making 47 million next year for not being as good as his job anymore, speaks volumes to how fortunate he is. There are people out there that have to work awful jobs for much less, to barely get by in life, and they don't have a choice. Westbrook has generational wealth, and he can literally decide to sit on his ass for the rest of his life, do nothing, pass down that money to his kids, grandkids, great grand kids, etc and probably still have enough money to move down further generations. Nobody is forcing him to continue to play basketball, and get heckled by fans.

Like obviously Dame >>> Maxey, but with Maxey on a cheap-ass rookie deal for 2 more years and Dame being on a supermax and coming off a major injury I can see it.  I also think their point is that with Maxey, Harden & Embiid, the Sixers are good enough to win the Finals as-is (Zach said this explicitly), so from that perspective no need to double down and mortgage more future assets with Maxey playing as well as he is right now.  I also think you could make the case that Maxey's speed is a unique trait & brings a unique dimension to the Sixers offense that Dame wouldn't (while athletically gifted, he's never been an up & down, fast-paced player because he destroys dudes in the half-court).",Celtics,192,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/t9rw2i/andrew_bogut_ive_heard_a_pretty_big_rumor_from/,0.4709,0.115,0.793,0.092

What in the ever loving fuck are you taking about? He wasn't ridiculed before he gave everyone a reason to ridicule him. Unless you're talking about college where he routinely quit on his team/refused to play? In which case it was deserved, just like the situation in Philly. You don't get to act like he has and then get angry when there are consequences. Plus, Simmons isn't the only NBA player that struggles with mental health but he's the only one pulling shit like this. He also only used mental health as an excuse for why he was refusing to play when his first 3-4 excuses didn't work. Any way you cut it, whether it's true or not, Simmons is making a mockery of mental health and he's now going to wield it as a weapon for getting money.

Moody+Kuminga had solid showings, Moody has an uncanny nose for the ball and demonstrated his improved defense and general BBIQ, should be getting all of Lee's minutes going forward.  Kuminga=big moterhfucking problem, nuff said.  

I love Hartenstein, dude is such a solid player with some serious upside, Clips scouting department light years ahead rn 

Hooking needs to be called more, so many dudes on both teams keep using the free arm to get around defenders in good position, its just frustrating too watch

‚ÄúOn the bright side ‚Äî if you can call it that ‚Äî at least two fans and two signs managed to get tossed. One of those signs belonged to John Lentz of nearby Akron, LeBron‚Äôs hometown. It read ‚ÄúLike Father, Like Son,‚Äù an underhanded reference to the parent who deserted James‚Äô family and left him to be raised by his mother.

‚ÄúThey told me it was offensive to families,‚Äù Lentz said.

With that sign in the hands of a security guard, he simply pulled out a second that read, ‚ÄúAkron Hates You Too, LeBron.‚Äù

2022-03-09,darkrabbit713,"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.

People on this subreddit hate /u/doubtthat11.

The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't read him in his prime.

Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball threads in the last couple decades. So you never watched The Big Doubter in his prime.

And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stats and analyzing karma. But here's the thing: memeing isn‚Äôt typed on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true upvote percentage"" or ""gild shares"" I know they know nothing about Redditing.

/u/doubtthat11‚Äôs redditing cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest /r/nba user ever, and one of the 5 best Redditors to ever bacon the narwhal.

So when I hear somebody say that /u/Westbricks_Nut_Garage is better than /u/doubtthat11, I laugh, because I know that anybody who read him in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have read reddit threads for a significant amount of time, so I know that /u/doubtthat11 is better.

You might be jealous of /u/doubtthat11‚Äôs forty million dollars, or jealous of his status as the greatest commenter in /r/NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls flair who watched basketball in the 22s, or a Lakers flair who watched basketball before the 22s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball commenting looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.

This sub would make you think that /u/doubtthat11 isn't even a top 100 Redditor ever.

However his reaction to this adversity is supporting the argument of his critics that he has always been a mentally weak player.

As a Bestbrook fan he put himself into a situation where it's hard to defend him.

2022-03-09,ZombieJesusOG,">I'm not gonna cast doubt on Simmons' mental health

I will, dude wants to get paid while providing minimal effort to do his job. It would be one thing if he dealt with boos while accompanying the team on the bench all season, or if he had tried to be part of practices, etc but he literally just sat around being a malcontent and got kicked out by someone known as a players coach the one time he showed up. Either Ben Simmons eats those fines or the next contract is less player friendly. I rarely side with ownership but that dude being paid for not working is a bad look and bad precedent. 

Plus it was all too convenient and he didn't even make an effort to provide the team with information on why he was on an ""excused"" break. This is a league where Jrue Holiday was paid during a long leave of absence to care for his wife's medical issue (deserved) and where Rui Hachimura was paid for a long leave of absence for mental health (again deserved). It is a very lenient and player friendly environment and Ben is doing his best to shit on all that goodwill and try to get the best of both worlds by refusing to play and using an excuse to get paid for that refusal.",Lakers,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/t9n9j3/neubeck_a_grievance_from_ben_simmons_and_his/,0.9881,0.172,0.784,0.043

Fournier is also a great wing on a solid contract.

He said he doesn't feel like taking his family to games, which is understandable, but it's also his own insecurity talking. Are there actually any reports of harassment aimed at family members?

""I‚Äôve kind of let it go in the past just because it never really bothered me, but it really kind of hit me the other day, honestly. Me and my wife was at teacher-parent conference for my son, and the teacher told me, she‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúNoah, he‚Äôs so proud of his last name. He writes it everywhere. He writes it on everything. He tells everybody, he walks around and says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Westbrook. Westbrook, that‚Äôs my last name.‚Äù And I kind of sat there in shock. And it hit me, like damn, I can no longer allow people ‚Äì for example,  Westbrick, to me, is now shaming. It‚Äôs like shaming my name. It‚Äôs my legacy for my kids. It‚Äôs a name that means more, not just to me, but to my wife, my mom, my dad are he ones that kind of paved the way for me. And that‚Äôs just one example. I mean, that kind of hit myself and my wife in a place where it‚Äôs not great, man. And I think a lot of times I let it slide, but it‚Äôs now time to put a stop to that and put it on notice there is a difference, and we need to make sure it‚Äôs understood. And every time I do hear it now, I will make sure that I address it and make sure that I nip that in the bud"".

It‚Äôs very unfortunate. It‚Äôs been like this for my entire career. I‚Äôve been blessed and super thankful for the ones around me and the ones that support me, but it‚Äôs really the shaming of my name, the shaming of my character, the shaming of who I am as a person is, to me, is not warranted. I haven‚Äôt done anything to anybody. I haven‚Äôt hurt anyone. I haven‚Äôt done anything but play basketball a way that people may not like. And this is just a game. This is just a game. This is not my entire life, and I think that is the ultimate thing that‚Äôs been for me. And I don‚Äôt like to harp on it. I just kind of want it out there. But once it starts to affect my family, my wife ‚Äì even today, my mom said something about it today. And it affects them even going to games. I don‚Äôt even want to bring my kids to the game, because I don‚Äôt want them to hear people calling their dad nicknames and other names for no reason because he‚Äôs playing the game that he loves. And it‚Äôs gotten so bad where my family don‚Äôt even want to home games, to any games because of not just the media across the globe using platforms constantly shame, shame, shame me. And it‚Äôs just super unfortunate, man. And it‚Äôs super upsetting to me, and I‚Äôm at a point to where I‚Äôm going la continue to address it.

2022-03-09,mediuqrepmes,"The challenge is, how do you turn Tobias into significant depth? You probably aren't getting multiple quality role players back for him in a single trade. You're presumably dumping assets to make that trade, so you're short on stuff to trade for additional depth, and you'd end up filling out the roster with vet minimums plus the MLE. 

Alternatively, if you can turn a Tobias package into a disgruntled star who's forcing his way out to play with Embiid and Harden, you can still use the MLE and vet minimums to fill out the roster with ring chasers, but now you have 3-4 stars depending on your view of Maxey.

2022-03-09,drjisftw,"Shower thought - is there a chance the Knicks take on Westbrook's contract?

NYK gets: Westbrook, Nunn, 2027 FRP

LAL gets: Randle, Fournier, Kemba

This is an ugly trade, but it's essentially an admission of failure by both teams that what they have now isn't working.

NYK hits a hard reset by getting off all of their bad contracts (also opens up minutes for all of the young guys) in exchange for 50M of expirings along with a pick in return. Westbrook provides them a point guard for the interim and if he doesn't buy in with the team then he's only there for a single year.

The Lakers turn their albatross contract into some depth they can work with.

2022-03-09,sivervipa,"Westbrook was never ready,made or prepared to play with the Lakers or play with Lebron. Being associated with 1 of those things is already going to be difficult because of the expectations doing both puts you under a microscope and every single thing you say and do both on and off the court will be analyzed.

Lebron has been under a microscope his entire career basically and the pressure he was under has only increased. 

His first stint with the Cavs he already had a target on his back from players like Paul pierce because they noticed how much attention he got i mean‚Ä¶ESPN were watching his games. Not to mention his draft class had so much hype Him,Bosh,Wade and Melo.


Then of course him making himself a villain by going to Miami. Which basically setup Lebron winning the East from 2011-2018 and winning 3 titles. Hell him just being 3-6 was already impressive because that‚Äôs alot of finals appearances.

Meanwhile what was Westbrook doing? A finals appearance with OKC,then battling the Spurs and the rising GSW until KD bounced. Making him the Hero of OKC by default and getting triple doubles. After KD left Westbrook never made it past the first round. 

He was just a hero for his regular season performances in OKC because he stayed around, then he joined Harden on the Rockets and were pretty successful their first year but ran into Lebron/AD in the bubble.

Basically what I‚Äôm saying is‚Ä¶the only thing that changed about Westbrook were the expectations,pressure and scrutiny he faced by joining Lebron and the Lakers. Westbrook has averaged around 5 turnovers his entire career they knew what they were getting. 

Westbrook just needs to go to a place where the expectations are not championship or bust. 

‚ÄúHopefully Make a playoff appearance or have a good/great regular season‚Äù is where he belongs. 

Westbrook should go to the kings or something‚Ä¶there‚Äôs literally no pressure. Imagine if he pulls off even a play-in appearance or even a slightly above or at .500 season.

Either that or the rebuilding Rockets again. I‚Äôm sure his mentorship would be welcomed by the young guys.",Heat,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/t9rma1/perk_westbrook_is_broken_mentally_he_is_not_even/,0.7475,0.077,0.869,0.054

AB self sabotages with no benefit to himself. That‚Äôs mental illness. Simmons seemed to have been surprised they could withhold his pay and now after getting the big thing he wanted is trying to recoup the money

All I‚Äôm saying is that Simmons‚Äô actions could just as easily have been done by a mentally healthy individual who was sick of Philly.

As far as ""super patriotic/nationalistic/etc"" Canada is obsessed with claiming they are better than the US, get the fuck outta here, lol. Most reasonable Americans are more critical of their government than Canadians are of their government. The only time I hear the national anthem or pledge of allegiance in the US is at sporting events, but I definitely hear it at sporting events in Canada too. You sit here and talk about being ignorant about what's happening outside of US when you are literally basing your opinion of the US on played out stereotypes and a few personal, anecdotal experiences. Main reason why Canada is generally more politically progressive than the US is because of how our senates/electoral college are set up. We elect our senators and every state gets two which leads to disproportionate representation, Canadian senators are appointed and are distributed in a way that doesn't make too much sense other than favoring more liberal provinces/territories.  Look at polls for progressive movements in the US and the majority supports all of them. Quit trying to pretend like you guys are that different, it's basically the same damn culture, lol.

2022-03-09,wsefy,"Most sports and esports tend to lean towards becoming more offense oriented over time, this is especially true of 3 point shooting in the NBA. 

There are a couple of reasons for this, firstly it's good for viewership as everyone can understand and enjoy great offense, not everyone appreciates good defense and it requires a much deeper understanding of the game to even know the fundamentals.

Secondly, offense is usually something you can practice individually and develop both in the fundamentals but also things that are within your playstyle, whereas defense is always on the back foot and is almost always in response to what the offense does; you're always playing their game.

Another factor is that the league has reached the stage where getting large guards and strong big men is no longer meta, you need everyone to be able to shoot from distance and bigs are mostly pick and roll/pick and pop players rather than back to the basket post up players. This also results in lower defensive output as players like curry, lillard, trey etc. become stars and run their teams offense with minimal defensive effort. 

3 pointers are too hard to defend and too valuable, makes no sense to shoot long 2s when you can either take a 3 or dish to a big man to finish close to the basket.

Lastly, having records be broken frequently is something that we'll see a lot more of as the long range shooting phenomenon continues, it brings a lot of attention to the active players and the league wants to push for that as its easier for the average fan to identify with 6'1 guards with deep shooting ability than 6'9 athletic forwards.",NA,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/t9xjrd/with_50_points_on_1519_fg_tonight_1011_ts_kyrie/,0.865,0.139,0.759,0.102

The thing we're seeing with Westbrook right now is actually kinda tragic. I'm 100% positive when he first heard those names he was thinking his game would shut people up. This isn't the first year he's been called Westbrick. In the past he's been able to get his numbers and that was that

But now... he can't do that. He's not able to get those numbers so now ""Westbrick"" stings a bit more because there's nothing he can do about it. It feels like the harder he tries, the worse he plays and all the while people are calling him names

So I don't feel like he's 100% upset with the names. His frustration is coming from the fact that he can no longer do anything about it",bwThunder,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/t9p9fx/undisputed_shannon_sharpe_on_westbrook_zero/,-0.6708,0.075,0.829,0.096

It wasn‚Äôt until his 3rd season where he finally started to become a good 3pt shooter. He had to drastically alter his form, and that took a lot of time and effort.

This feels really weird typing this out right now since I'm used to him being WebEmbiid but for the next 2ish years I honestly think he'll be just as healthy if not more healthy than KD mostly just due to his age.

I have nothing to say about Kyrie because I don't trust him at all.

East is this year and every West team aside from Phoenix having major question marks (and the Sixers match up well with Phoenix, they'd have the 2 best players on the floor even if Phoenix has the next 4 best on their side).  I also agree that 10 times out of 10 I would sacrifice the speed of Maxey for the masterful craft of Dame, and that having Dame, Harden & Embiid run the offense for 48 minutes would be positively unreal.


Your last question is the pertinent one, and the answer has always been & hopefully will always be an unequivocal ""no"" from Dame about leaving the Blazers.  He means so much to this city and has a chance to surpass Drexler & Walton as the franchise GOAT, i also think that Dame is comfortable in his own skin & is not worried about a championship defining his legacy (or at least he knows that bringing a title to Portland would mean more than going elsewhere to do it & that is worth it to him).",Celtics,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/t9rw2i/andrew_bogut_ive_heard_a_pretty_big_rumor_from/,0.9893,0.178,0.804,0.018

2022-03-09,Competitive-Let4759,"The US has a more spread out rural population than Canada so it may seem more widespread in that sense, but our urban population is also A LOT larger than Canada. I mean, Montreal is your second largest metro and it's approx the same size as Minneapolis/StPaul metro (16th largest metro).

Also, Canada has mass shootings, Canada has crazy antivaxxer protests. Maybe it's easier for you to see it in the US because of the pre-existing stereotypes and seeing through a foreigners lens. But if you do watch the news you would know places like Minneapolis are anything but patriotic, lol.

Don't get me wrong, I love Canada. I have family in Montreal that I visit and have been to Manitoba/Western Ontario a bunch. Just get tired of Canadians constantly comparing themselves to the US, like get over it. The only way we're really different is in government/political structure, and it's easier to live in the rural parts of the US.

2022-03-09,sugaad,"I think that, generally speaking, you are quite right that empathy is a good thing and the world could use more of it. My concerns are threefold:

1. Most people don't really affect the world all that much, and the ones who do are incentivized (and likely predisposed) to show relatively little empathy. E.g. we could magically increase the empathy levels of 50 million Russians, but that would count for nothing if Putin's empathy level remains the same. (this is a little bit of an exaggeration and oversimplification.)
2. Shakespeare's contention aside, the quality of mercy might actually be a little strained. I'm not convinced that most people have an endless font of empathy - if that's the case, it seems to me that people should be cautious about how and where they expend their concern for others.
3. I think empathy has multiple facets, and some are more useful/accurate than others. e.g. powerful person loses their child to a disease. there is no harm in non-powerful people empathizing with the feeling of loss and heartbreak. And its unlikely that that empathy could be easily co-opted in a way that hurts the empathizer's interests. I think the more common and, in my opinion detrimental, manifestation of empathy is in the economic realm. We can quibble about how to define empathy but ultimately in my mind it comes down to one's ability to place oneself in another's position. I think that's why we see so many poor conservatives - it's not greed in any real sense, because they aren't going to pay more in taxes no matter how they vote - it's misplaced empathy. ""I sure wouldn't want to pay 50% of my income in taxes, so it would be wrong to make a rich person do that. (""plus I might be rich myself one day"" - but I think this thinking is overemphasized, and I think that many poor conservatives truly believe that the economic policies they oppose are categorically wrong for what are basically Kantian reasons.) 

this comment has become a bit of a mess, but I guess my ultimate point is that empathy is a super-powerful human response, and bad actors can take advantage of that intentionally or incidentally. But overall it's more good than bad and if I had to choose between universal empathy and the opposite I'd choose empathy every time.",Pelicans,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/t9p9fx/undisputed_shannon_sharpe_on_westbrook_zero/,-0.963,0.112,0.745,0.143

He's shooting so well you can't just let him keep shooting the ball uncontested so he's going to keep going to the line too. 

People talk about coaches not making adjustments to try and shut players down but in situations like that there is literally nothing you can do. The only viable option realistically is try and hurt that player but that's just not a strategy teams or players are really willing to use anymore for good reason. 

Not many players are able to take over an entire playoff like Dirk did, I know I'm a Mavs fan and this sounds like a homerism take but that was easy a top 5 all-time playoff performance by singular player.

I can guarantee you, that ppl just attend regular public schools in pretty much every european country I know of when they join an academy.

I also don't see how european talent trains more, since it is capped at 20hrs a week just like by the NCAA, but 20 hrs a week is a huge commitment, if you go to school/university as well.

I had 4-6 hrs organized training a week, but you do other stuff as well that consumes time, you work out in the gym, do conditioning and study the game. When I quit playing I literally didn't know what to do with my time.

The academy system basically does the same the HS & Uni systems do in the US, they concentrate the talent where the best coaches are and optimizes training.",NA,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/t9ps77/joel_embiid_on_nikola_jokic_hes_a_monster_what/,0.992,0.201,0.77,0.029

2022-03-09,HisExcellency20,"That's the nature of sign and trades. You get way less than what the player is worth. That's why the Nets traded Harden now because at least this way they get Ben and are not forced to take Harris because that's all the Sixers are offering and Harden will only sign with Philly. 

So in this very unlikely scenario Beal would only sign in Philly so the Wizards can take Harris back or get literally nothing and watch him walk.",76ers,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/t9rw2i/andrew_bogut_ive_heard_a_pretty_big_rumor_from/,0.5236,0.053,0.947,0

I played with and against ppl who were in academies and most of them quit and went to a university, they didn't need a scholarship for it, cuz attending university is free here, the government even gives you an interest free loan if your parents are not wealthy enough and you only have to pay back half of it, capped at 10k.

But yeah, top level NCAA athletes are obviously living in a Care Bear wonderland, where they can chose how much time they spend training, while European top level talent is trained in conditions the resemble the red room.

The team they project to have the most cap is the Magic at 29 million. The wizards can offer 50 million a year. It would be a historic fumbling of the bag by Beal if he walks. In other words to acquire Beal you have to give up just as much value as you would to acquire Beal normally. Maybe slightly less if he actively wants to leave. But enough that they'd consider the offer in a normal trade for beak essentially.

Probably because he's actually a better shooter than people think lol. He doesn't shoot threes especially well, although has had seasons approaching league average. He has averaged below league average on FTs for most of his career, but has been above average this season. But that doesn't mean he's a bad shooter. He's insanely good at finishing in the paint (not just on dunks/layups) and also one of the best, like, 5 midrange shooters in the NBA. People just don't value midrange shooting.

2022-03-09,jdtwister,"Wolves are firmly in the middle of the standings in the west in 7th place, looking likely at the playins this year. Given that there are 15 teams in the west, 7th is basically average, so I think mediocre is fair. The warriors were in that spot last year, and I‚Äôd say they were a mediocre team last year. 

I love your team long term and I‚Äôm a huge ant fan. I think the team is in good hands and could be a 3-4 seed in the next few seasons. Right now mediocre is fair in my opinion. 

Warriors have been straight garbage for a few weeks now. Tonight was a good night, but I expect a few more terrible games or fall aparts until Draymond comes back. Over the season though, the warriors are third in the west and are generally seen as a title contender if mostly healthy. They are considered to be near the top of the league this season. 

The smaller the sample size, the more difficult it is to make a characterizing judgement. I try to think in terms of season as a whole, based on roster, past performance, current performance, and projections. 

My rankings:
- Likely championship: Suns, Bucks, Warriors, Nets
- Big playoff threats: Bulls, Heat, Grizzlies, 76ers
- Unlikely playoff successes: Nuggets, Jazz, Celtics, Cavs
- Likely first round exits: Raptors, Wolves, Mavs
- Fringe playoff teams: Clippers, Lakers, Hornets, Hawks
- Subpar teams: Wizards, Knicks, Pacers, Pelicans 
- Bad teams: Blazers, Spurs, Kings
- Tanking: OKC, Pistons, Magic, Rockets",NA,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ta0ni2/post_game_thread_the_golden_state_warriors_4421/,0.7947,0.116,0.822,0.063

There was a report he wants to go to Philly. Beal doesn't fit on that team with Harden and Embiid. Not enough shots to go around. If Beal is not your primary scorer what else is he doing?

The Wizards would play better team ball if you replaced Beal for Maxey. I 100% believe that. Maxey is not going to take a high volume of shots. More players will be involved because of that.

2022-03-09,NextMention20,"Then what about the recent straw poll at the all star break? Giannis, Embiid, and Jokic are very close in team record and are all dominant statistically, but Embiid and Jokic were far and away voted in MVP over Giannis , by the media. Embiid got 45 first place votes, Jokic had 43 first place votes, and Giannis only received 9 first place votes. Currently, all odds sites have Embiid and Jokic as clear favorites for MVP. The MVP ladder on NBA.com has appeared to have Jokic and Embiid as #1 and #2 for over a month now. It seems that all signs are pointing to those 2 being clear MVP favorites at the moment, despite the team records and stats being relatively similar between all 3 candidates. It seems more like a clear 2 man battle for MVP by the media, and Giannis has seemingly dropped down to a solid 3rd option, by the media and all betting sites.

Idk, maybe I am wrong. The way I see it, Giannis will have to have a clear record advantage to even get MVP consideration.

And if you're referring to the overthetop bullshit like death threats, I've not seen a single person come close to being OK with that nonsense.

Do you actually know anything about his kid's life or are you talking out of your ass?

2022-03-09,ArenSteele,"Not a lawyer, but I don‚Äôt think they need to prove the team did anything intentionally. I believe their argument will be that his inability to play was due to mental health disability, and should be treated no differently than an injured knee, and therefore the withholding of funds was not legal.

They just need to prove that Ben was mentally incapacitated, AND that it‚Äôs a reasonable statement to treat that incapacitation as any other injury.

They‚Äôll obviously introduce fan behaviour as evidence contributing to his incapacity, but they‚Äôll have to do a lot more than that I‚Äôd think.

First, he's in the Final Four and part of that draft class. Meh

Second, he's on the young Thunder who weren't a threat to the Rockets. Very cool.

Third, the Thunder are good. Respect.

Fourth, they trade us Harden and then we are rivals. Respect, but I'm mad at how good he is.

Fifth, the Thunder sadly fall apart and are still rivals, but they never beat us. Respect, but I'm happy because we seem to be a better team. 

Sixth, he gets traded to us and they have that streak. Mad respect and we're going to win the title because the West is wide open.

Seventh, we lose an embarrassing series and he's gone. Wait what just happened?

I mean, if you just go on the stats there is no way Embiid should be considered over Giannis, his stats are just straight up better in nearly every way, while having effectively the same record.  Scoring slightly less, but has the edge in rebounds, and a big edge in assists, all on much better efficiency, while playing much better defense.

But because he is Giannis he is penalized, and has to be much better across the board.  

Kind of sucks, but that is just how it is.  Giannis should absolutely be right there with Jokic and Embiid, if not ahead of them, in the MVP race.

Harris makes way too much money, but he's a good player and a good fit next to Embiid. I don't see what's stopping them from building around Maxey/Harden/Harris/Embiid for the next few years. They could realistically win the finals *this* year.

2022-03-09,InstantLunch,">My scenario is somewhat far-fetched, but I think turning Harris into multiple quality depth pieces is trickier than it sounds.

But it is as stupid as it sounds! Jesus, turning Harris (and probably 4 firsts) into Beal would make this team utterly unguardable while also being able to survive injuries and prolong Harden's ""prime."" It's a no-brainer move that would certainly extend their window.

The thing that you also gotta keep in mind, is that when you have these stars locked up for 3-4 years, you get to reload with the MLE and BAE multiple times. That's how the Heat won their titles. They were too shallow the first year especially since Mike Miller was hurt (yet still could've won if LeBron played better), but then won the next year after getting Battier (and Allen the next).",Bulls,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/t9rw2i/andrew_bogut_ive_heard_a_pretty_big_rumor_from/,0.9252,0.148,0.782,0.07

2022-03-09,vNocturnus,"As a Kings fan I will never believe the refs in the NBA are  free from *corruption*.

NBA refs are 110% absolutely biased and anyone who says otherwise is probably trolling or crazy. It's a known fact that rookies, unknown players, and bad/unpopular teams get garbage calls; good teams, popular teams, and stars (especially guys with a rep for drawing fouls) get way more favorable calls; players with a rep for being ""emotional"" get techs way more easily while established stars get way *more* leeway for techs; so on and so forth. All of that is just a begrudgingly accepted fact of the NBA officiating and it has been for decades, at least.

Kings have gotten the short end of all those things for most of those decades. Obviously they aren't the only ones, but like, there are obvious, statistically significant hard numbers that you can easily point to that show that type of bias. Even just within this season - with the trade moving Sabonis to the Kings, his FT numbers per game have dropped dramatically from when he was on the Pacers, and his own foul numbers per game have gone up similarly, despite playing essentially the same. (And, side note, he already was getting pretty stiffed in Indy to begin with. It's so bad now that he got ejected for the first time in his career the other night with how frustrated he was; normally a pretty collected guy.)

But it's even worse than all that. Stuff like Rudy getting ejected immediately after calling out the refs isn't bias, it's targeted suppression. Stuff like the rigged 2002 WCF that got Donaghy fired is outright illegal activity and almost certainly still ongoing in some fashion - after all, many of the refs *known to be* involved in that debacle are still reffing. It's almost a guarantee that the refs are still intentionally influencing betting lines. There's a good reason the NBA has numerous systems set up to hush, penalize, and fine *any* personnel - even team commentators and analysts - that say *anything* bad about the refs: because if they let people talk about it, it brings more attention to just how pathetically bad to the point of obvious malfeasance the refereeing is in this league.",Kings,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ta0o5v/shai_gilgeousalexander_on_why_he_doesnt_complain/,-0.9215,0.111,0.764,0.125

That completely proves my point. In order to get an education you have to quit your sport to focus on studying for, getting into college, and maintaining your grades. In the US you can take sports as seriously as all your pairs who also want to go pro while still being able to get an education and not having to quit the sport. That system is much better for breeding athletes but it sacrifices the ones that give it that much effort but still don't make it.

And I'm literally in that ""Care Bear Wonderland"". I'm not a college athlete, but I'm friends with many. If you're not worried about going pro or getting play time, you can truly spend most of your time studying or being social. You have to give effort but it's no different from any other extracurricular activity.

This is all the confirmation I needed for what I already knew that you haven't been listening, taking in, and being educated to what I'm saying because no where did I say the collegiate system is better.

>They quit way before the were eligible for university

That's my point. In America you can play for as long as you're interested in the sport. I played sports competitively while applying to colleges and I was able to keep my grades good enough to get into a good school because the system here is more suited to mix education with sports... which is what I've been saying all along. You continue to prove my point.

Bucks were awful towards the all star break and thats what killed Giannis' social capital at the time. Right now they are streaking. If they streak enough to get *ahead* of Philly those straw polls will turn on their head. As they did between earlier in the season and the AS break..

All Giannis needs is finishing ahead of the other two. Really. There was never a time that such a strong MVP candidate missed out on the MVP all the while finishing top 2 on his conference and ahead of the field. Heck he is leading PER and is close 2nd to WS/48 the two favorite stats of the MVP voters (those who lead in either won 12 out of the last 14 MVPs).

I think you see a media bias that is not there.

I don't really agree with that assessment, their role players aren't up to scratch just yet and they still have Doc. 

> so from that perspective no need to double down and mortgage more future assets with Maxey playing as well as he is right now.

This is Morey's MO though, he's always star hunting. Plus, the best thing about having 3 stars is it's insurance in case you lose 1 to injury, you can still compete with 2 of them. 

>  also think you could make the case that Maxey's speed is a unique trait & brings a unique dimension to the Sixers offense that Dame wouldn't (while athletically gifted, he's never been an up & down, fast-paced player because he destroys dudes in the half-court).

This is true, but I don't think this outweighs the chance of having Harden/Dame being able to take turns running your offense for 48 minutes. Plus you are also jettisoning Tobias as part of the deal. 

I know a lot of Sixers fans wouldn't want to do that deal as they are emotionally attached to Maxey now, but I guarantee you Daryl Morey isn't, and will 100% pull the trigger on a trade to get Dame if that opportunity presents itself.

He would know how much it takes and what sacrifices you have to make to stay in such an elite academy regardless. A very small percentage of NCAA athletes are barred from going pro because most would stay 4 years of college in the first place. 99.9% of NCAA athletes don't go pro, but the ones that don't come out with a college degree.
