2022-07-14,U_Dont_Smoke_Peyote,"My favorite quote from sir Charles about facing MJ

> You know, I'd always thought that I was the best player, to be honest with you. I always thought, Michael Jordan when he started winning, he just had more help than me. So, when I finally came to Phoenix, I had told the late, great Cotton Fitzsimmons, 'Hey dude, I'm the best basketball player in the world. We're going to the Finals.' And he said, 'That's why I traded for you.'

> I actually thought I was the best. I thought Bird and Magic just had better players. So, I said, 'Listen dude, I'm going to the Finals this year. Dan Majerle, Kevin Johnson... That's what I need. We're going to the Finals.' He says, 'Well Michael's gonna be there.' I said, 'Cotton, I think I'm better than Michael Jordan.' He says, 'We will see when you get there.'

> So, we actually got nervous before Game 1. We struggled. The pressure got to the guys on the team. I played decent, but then I think the other guys were nervous. So Game 2, I'm talking to my daughter.

> She said, 'Dad? Are y'all gonna win tonight?'

> I said, 'Baby, your dad is the best basketball player in the world. I'm going to dominate the game tonight.' And I remember... I think I had like 46, 47. I played great. And Michael had 52.

> And I got home that night, and my daughter was crying, and she said, 'Dad, y'all lost again.'

> I said, 'Baby, I think Michael Jordan's better than me.'

> She said, 'Dad, you've never said that before.'

> I said, 'Baby, I've never felt like that before.'",Hawks,2150,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vygoo9/todd_charles_barkley_on_bradley_beals_251_million/,0.9905,0.188,0.758,0.055

2022-07-14,vendetta2115,"That‚Äôs gotta be some Earth-shattering stuff to a young Charles Barkley. Growing up, Charles was undoubtedly the best on his team at every level, and always getting better.  He was told over and over how he was the best, and had all the evidence for it, too. He never sees anyone better than him, and has this total belief in his own supremacy as a player. And then you see this other guy doing things that just seem impossible to you. To everyone. And for the first time in your entire life, you see someone who is a better player than you. Not only that, the greatest player of all time.

It‚Äôs like being Phil Mickelson in 1997 and watching this relatively unknown rookie, a 21-year-old Tiger Woods, win the Masters by 12 strokes. You‚Äôre confident, you think you‚Äôre the best, or at least in the conversation for the best, and then this kid comes up and just smokes you, makes you look like a mediocre player. Setting record after record. Driving farther than anyone else playing. He‚Äôs got the best short game out there, repeatedly one-putting, and no-putting with insanely difficult chip-ins. He‚Äôs not even on the back nine yet and it‚Äôs already over. He could bogey every hole and still win.

It‚Äôs gotta mess with your head.

Mark O‚ÄôMeara (1998 Masters Champion) has this story about the first time he played with Tiger Woods.  It wasn‚Äôt a public match, they were just playing for fun. Tiger was something like 20 years old at the time. Mark is 39 or 40 years old.

The first day they go out and play 18 holes. Tiger shoots an incredible 59. Just an unbelievable round. He‚Äôs 13 under par and up double digits against Mark after just one round. The next day, Tiger starts the second round with **a birdie on the first hole and a hole in one on the second hole**.

Once you go pro you can‚Äôt go back, so while this cutoff is going to help the next LeBron accelerate their payday a year, it‚Äôs also going to mean more guys that maybe would have been better served developing a bit in college busting

He isn't wrong you can see that the team was built for 1v1 match ups with two (3) star scorers. Funny enough, Harden in this point of his career is more of a team player than he was in Houston. Harden on the court would move the ball, facilitate which was totally against what the Nets wanted from him (so did the fans). I'm interested to see Harden and the 76ers really meld together.

Nets on the other hand are thinking this is Brooklyn street ball, which is awesome if they were to communicate that. Kyrie and KD are such historians and got love for the game but it doesn't translate in todays NBA when youre made to be a superstar who's supposed to be winning rings.

2022-07-14,A_Polite_Noise,"I don't know about a full rebrand, since we are only *just* about to start our 10th year in Brooklyn/since the last rebrand.

But I really would love the Brooklyn Nets to:

1.  Add a 3rd color to the black & white.  Blue?  Red?  Green?  Yellow?  I don't care.  I just think we need a splash of color, even just a little one, to make the logo and brand ""pop"" a little better.  

2.  Get a mascot again.  Not the Brooklyn Knight, unless you totally redesign him.  Bring back Sly the Silver Fox?  Or, someone on /r/gonets suggested a pigeon mascot, which would be legit fun and make for a fun costumed mascot the kid fans could dig on.  Something like that with a sense of humor, that's *fun* the way the best mascots are (Benny the Bull, The Raptor).  They tried to make the Brooklyn Knight too ""cool"", with the serious-yet-dumb-looking costume, the Marvel tie-in comic, etc.

However, if you asked me ""what about a true full rebrand?"", I'd say:  

**CHANGE.  OUR.  NAME.  TO.  THE.  SWAMP.  DRAGONS.  YOU.  COWARDS.**. I would seriously love if they just went with the exact, corny 90's style redesign (with the purple and turquoise) that almost happened 3 decades ago.

2022-07-14,Sociojoe,"Brooklyn allegedly wants all star/all nba quality players (or close to it). I looked at recent (last three years) all stars/all nba players to see which of these guys might be available for Durant.  I don't' think there are many guys. 

1. Durant isn't getting traded to the Warriors (No Steph, Wiggins, or Draymond)
2. Durant isn't getting traded for younger players in the same tier as Durant/young franchise cornerstones (Embiid, Doncic, Tatum, Booker, Morant, Jokic, Young, or Giannis)
3. Durant isn't likely getting traded for a good young player from a team not in immediate contention (LeMelo, Cunningham, Mobley, and Barnes)
4. Durant isn't going to be traded for an older former all star who has fallen off and Brooklyn can't build around (Conley, Paul, Lowry)
5. Durant isn't going to be traded for older cornerstone guys who would be a fairly lateral move (Harden, Lillard, Lebron, or Kawhi) 
6. Durant can't be traded for guys from his own team (Simmons and Kyrie)
7. Some guys are just, plain, unlikely (Gobert, Sabonis, and Murray were just traded for example)
8. We already known Minnesota refused KAT and Edwards.
9. Because Ben Simmons is on the roster, a bunch of additional guys can't be easily targeted (Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Michael Porter Jr., Zion, SGA, Garland, and De'Aaron Fox)

That doesn't leave a lot of guys to build a trade around: 

1. Bradley Beal 
2. Paul George 
3. Randle 
4. Vucevic 
5. Anthony Davis 
6. DeMar Derozan
7. Jarrett Allen 
8. Butler 
9. Khris Middleton.
10. Fred Vanvleet 
11. Pascal Siakam
12. Brandon Ingram
13. Jrue Holiday
14. Mikal Bridges
15. Jaren Jackson Jr.
16. Miles Bridges
17. Ayton.

Not exactly a lot of guys. I think Beal, George, and Davis are unlikely due to their respective status with their individual teams.  I think Vucevic  Holiday, Middleton, Butler, and DeRozan are a little too old for what the Nets envision, but they still might be possible. I don't think Randle has the trade value that the Nets are looking for and I don't think they'd ever trade him to the Knicks.  I also don't think they'd trade for Butler because of potential attitude issues. Obviously Miles Bridges is no longer a possibility. 

That really just leaves Siakam, Ayton, JJJ, Mikal Bridges, VanVleet, Ingram, and Allen. Maybe LeMelo, Cunningham, Mobley, and Barnes are there too but I doubt it. 

Anyone else I missed?

Both Herro and RJ are flawed players. It comes down to whether you think RJ can become a reliable scorer, something he has been unable to do, or whether you think Herro can become average defensively or if a team can just surround him with other good defenders.

Traditionally betting on the offensive talent is the better deal, especially since we‚Äôre not talking about a Jimmy Butler/Kawhi Leonard level defender thus far with Barrett.

i would much rather have Herro and Jovic in Miami or JJJ in Memphis or some talent from Orlando plus picks than Evan fucking Fournier and Quickley. To think we might trade away a guy who will be a perennial all star putting up 30+ ppg in the post season for 30 year old Fournier and potentially some 26th, 28th pick is ludicrous.

the reason you know this narrative is ridiculous is because not a single player knicks fans would be unwilling to part with has been proposed in these mock trades.

next big knicks proposal according to r/nba, knicks trade Fournier and second round draft picks for Ja Morant.",Jazz,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vyn524/jazz_in_the_donovan_mitchell_era_three_600/,0.6956,0.103,0.836,0.062

A lot of legends played in the 90s, but fact of the matter is most of their *teams* were not that good. The fact we're talking about Kenny Smith being a major secondary contributor kind of says everything when nowadays your major secondary contributors are guys like Kyrie/Love, Draymond/Klay, Anthony Davis, Parker/Ginobli/Kawhi, etc etc. You simply cannot really win anymore without having any other all-stars on your team like Hakeem did when Jordan was gone.

Toronto‚Äôs large enough where I think they would have hung on to the Raptors no matter what but if the attendance suffered long enough, the NBA could have moved them to an NBA-only market like OKC well before the Sonics moved there.

VC is a big reason why basketball became popular in Toronto and across Canada as a whole. Look at all the young Canadian talent across the league that grew up watching VC‚Äôs Raptors.

What the model aims to accomplish is to map the input X (in this case, a low quality video) to the correct output Y (in this case, a high quality 4k video). It learns to map the input by learning a function f such that we can get f(X) as close to Y as possible. f is a function that takes in the input X and outputs f(X). In this example, X is the low quality 1997 footage, and f(X) is the video in this post.

Since there are so many 4k videos out there, we can use these videos as the true data Y, and their lower quality variant as the input data X. The models learns from these examples.

2022-07-14,Whackedjob,The numbers don't really back this up. His percent of 2 point field goals that were assisted actually went up compared to the last 2 years (and his 3 point field goals assisted is still over 90%) so it's not like he's taking more pull up iso shots than before (or at least not hitting more of them). His problem is that he doesn't have a strong skill that he can rely on. He shoots well below league average at every single distance with 3 point being the only one within even 5% of league average. This profile makes him look like high volume early Lonzo or a poor man's Minnesota Wiggins. I really like RJ and watching him you can tell he gives a fuck but on both ends of the court the numbers have him as a below average player.

The problem with Herro last year was that he stopped scoring in the playoffs (at least in the later rounds because of injury) and when he‚Äôs not scoring he no longer has value.

Dragic would have had a much bigger role on the Raptors than he got on the Nets. If he bought into the team culture, he could have averaged 20-25 minutes a night easily especially with FVV sitting out.

I have no issue with Dragic, I just think it's kinda disingenuous to say that the only reason he left was due to playing time and not having a role.

It was the Raptors' 20th season, and throughout the year they were honouring former players (whether they be retired or still active at the time) with video tributes whenever they came by to play or happened to be in town. When the Grizzlies were in town and they started to play the tribute for him after the first timeout, there were boos to start but then people started cheering. 

Basically, it was total conditioning by the organization that turned the tide. It wasn't like the fans collectively decided ""you know what? We've booed him enough, let's cheer him now."" I was at his last game in Toronto before that tribute the previous season when he was playing with the Mavs, and aside from a few contrarians in VC jerseys, he got booed loudly every time he touched the ball (including by me).

As someone who still hasn't completely warmed up to Vince Carter and still holds plenty of resentment, I'm all for ""moving on"" and if other Raptors fans like him and forgive him, or never hated him to begin with, fine.

2022-07-14,WitOfTheIrish,"That's...not how that works though.  The NBA doesn't employ the players, each team does.  The teams act as an association working together and bargain with the players, who are unionized.  The team a player contracts with could in fact could prevent a player from playing on contract in another league.  

I guess they couldn't stop them from seeking other types of jobs, if that is what you meant, but they could prevent other basketball contracts from happening.

It's the same reason as when an NBA team drafts a player from a European team, the drafting team needs to negotiate a buyout of any remaining years on the contract, or else just retain their draft rights and let them continue playing in the other league.

It works this way in the NBA because the players are unionized and bound by the text of the CBA.  Contracts and their structure are agreed upon by the players and team owners.

Toronto is the most multicultural/multiethnic in that there‚Äôs lots of people from all over the world‚Ä¶but people don‚Äôt mention that it‚Äôs like 8% black and even less Latino people. So yes there‚Äôs tons of diversity and lots of immigrants from all over the world, but a city like Oakland or NYC or something is more racially diverse because it‚Äôs like 25% split between white, black, Asian, and Latino people

Edit: the census is done differently in Canada too, which makes this discussion more confusing depending on which country perspective you look at. I think there they group South Asian, East Asian, middle eastern as separate races. In America it‚Äôs just Asian.

2022-07-14,Sociojoe,"From a feasibility standpoint, it works, but from a realism standpoint it will never happen. 

1. The current trade being discussed between the Nets and Lakers is Kyrie for Westbrook + all the remaining Lakers picks. Both sides are considering it. Assuming for a second both sides agree, then that means the rest of the trade is, essentially, KD for AD.  That return is likely much less than the Nets are hoping to get for KD.  Davis has not covered himself in glory the last little while, he's older, and he's injury prone.  The Lakers really don't have anything else to add to balance out the fact the Nets can get a better deal for KD elsewhere.  

2. If they skipped the Kyrie portion and just did AD + picks/swaps for KD, it might be closer to what the Nets hope/expect to get for KD, but then there is no reason for them to trade Kyrie for Westbrook and, again, it doesn't work.

3. Klutch.  AD is represented by one of Lebron's best friends who runs the Klutch agency. Neither AD or Lebron will make any attempt to split themselves up and will likely fight to stay together. That adds another dimension to how silly it would become.

4. The Nets are already  far over the cap and aren't happy about it.  The extra 4M it adds to the Nets cap is actually 16M+ in extra spending from the luxury tax from my understanding.  While some billionaires might not care, others won't be happy sending out that much extra money.",NA,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vog2a4/2022_free_agency/,0.7441,0.092,0.834,0.074

Sucks that the blood clot costs him those extra years that would have cemented his legacy, but I believe he would have made that top 75 players with a couple more good seasons.

He's getting older, he's been injury prone for a while and he still has a massive contract extension coming up.

That's a harder case to make

I just think Golden State is in an ideal situation right now and they shouldn't do anything to fuck it up. You know this core can win a chip because they just did it, so you keep running it back until Steph and Dray decline, and then you have a bunch of talented young players who, if they improve, can keep you in contention with Steph and Dray operating as a supporting cast.

2022-07-14,milkplantation,"I'm not excusing the complex that some Raptors fans have developed about players not wanting to be in TO, but I think you have some of the facts mixed up.

Dragic was a piece in the Kyle Lowry trade. Lowry was one of the most beloved Raptors of all time so fans expected a solid return. Upon his arrival in Toronto, Dragic promptly stated that he had higher ambitions which is fair enough, but as a result of saying this publicly, he tanked his trade value. This obviously upset Raptors fans, particularly so given that there was some emotional baggage with Dragic being an asset in the Lowry trade.

Later on Dragic stated that the Raptors FO told him he wasn't part of the team's vision, but this went against everything the Raptors FO had said at the time of the trade. Shortly after Dragic said this, [it was reported that](https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/article/packed-raptors-crowd-relentlessly-boo-dragic-in-his-return-to-toronto/) he had asked for a leave from the team to attend to a personal matter and that the Raptors were still seeking a veteran backup point guard.

There is some speculation around why Dragic wanted the leave, but either way, the optics are horrible. This guy was traded to the Raptors, said he wanted out, then asked for a leave so that he wasn't working with the team. I don't care one way or another, but it's certainly rational criticism and far from a fake narrative.",Raptors,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vy3qyr/matej_sportinfo_dragic_describes_his_time_playing/,0.1638,0.097,0.812,0.091

Slowest pace in basketball, not a single healthy point guard on the roster, Randle totally malfunctioning. 

That‚Äôs a lot to overcome for a 21 year old player still developing. Still, Herro‚Äôs a more advanced offensive player at the moment, but he also gets to play for the best coach in basketball and the best player development staff in the league (imo).

2022-07-14,IamSkywalking,"RJ Barrett, Obi Toppin, Immanuel Quickley & multiple picks?

I would never make such an offer for Donovan Mitchell if I were the Knicks.

People will point to the Gobert deal and say ""well, Mitchell is worth more than that"", but there wasn't a single asset included in that deal that is equivalent to RJ Barrett, or quite frankly, Quickley. I know that some folks would slot Vanderbilt ahead of IQ - I wouldn't - but it doesn't even matter.

The draft picks are nice, for sure, but Mitchell is quickly becoming a budget Dame Lillard - an exciting offensive star whose inability to defend at a passable level is a fatal flaw for his team.

If the Knicks were a franchise like, say, haha, the Utah Jazz....maybe this would be something they should look at. Mitchell would bring in fans and revenue and excitement. For a small market team, that might trump playoff potential.

In a market like New York, where the fans are die-hard and the team is going to make money regardless, all your doing is capping your championship potential. Super Yuck!

Broussard seemed to also be alluding to that Black players ""especially"" would face significabt racism, not just not feeling at home. Which is why it makes sense to highlight Toronto is a multicultural and inclusive city where such racism isn't broadly tolerated (as Broussard implies). And there are still plenty of other cities in the US that are less diverse and more possibly likely to make a Black American player to not feel at home than Toronto.

2022-07-14,rtb001,"I mean I don't have access to his scans or anything, but the pattern of treatment is concerning to say the least. Basically the pattern would be you suffer the first disc herniation, whether through injury or it is partly congenital (I suspect maybe partly congenital given how young he was at first injury). If that herniation fails conservative treatment like shots or meds, then you need to go in and cut the herniated disc out to relieve the inflammation and nerve impingement. 

Problem is to do that you have to cut away some of the surrounding structures holding the spine together, bits of bone, ligaments etc. Yes the disc issue is solved, but that level of the spine becomes a bit weaker, and stress gets shifted to the next level up (or down), and the added stress will cause THAT level's disc to start degenerate or herniate. Then you have to go in and do discectomy on that level, which weakens it and starts stressing the next level, and so on, and he's on surgery number 3 already.

2022-07-14,Mender0fRoads,"Not really true at most schools. 

Football/basketball typically make money, but most if not all of the ""revenue"" is used to support sports that lose money on their own. A lot of athletic departments run at a deficit, and even if coaches were paid a fraction of what they are, distributing that money among hundreds of athletes per school would provide a pretty meager salary. At Texas, for example, the football and men's basketball head coaches combine to make about $11.4 million. UT has 688 student athletes. That's roughly $16,000 per athlete. That's not nothing, but UT also pays its coaches more than almost anyone. You could cut that in half (and then some) for most schools.

Those salaries also don't (usually) have anything to do with educational funds, too, so comparing coach salaries vs. professors makes no sense.

The real injustice IMO is the money made by ESPN and other broadcasters. Billions made selling ads against games, with absolutely none of it going to athletes.",SuperSonics,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vy83p1/cbs_sportsadam_silver_in_favor_of_lowering_nba/,-0.8891,0.043,0.85,0.107

2022-07-14,PsychoM,"Nah you wrong.

The Stanley Cup originally was only the cup at the top with a small base. That's why it's called the Stanley *Cup.* It became a tradition to engrave the winners of the cup on plaques but they quickly ran out of space and had to add a ring underneath the cup to accommodate. As the sport grew, the Stanley Cup also grew with it, adding rings every time they ran out of space. Now, when a new ring is needed every 13th year, they simply remove the oldest ring and archive it at the Hockey Hall of Fame. So the Stanley Cup's shape is fixed, but the history remains.

The Stanley Cup is infinitely cooler than the Larry O'B, you make your mark literally on the history of the sport, instead of getting a sterilized chunk of metal you can put in a cabinet somewhere exactly like the other chunks of metal.

They didn't say ""let's just make it as big as possible"" and design the Stanley Cup like that from the start, it became like that as the sport evolved.

It never worked. No one in DC took to the wizrds name and next to nobody ever wore the jerseys, even the Jordan ones. I didn't really start to see folks wearing jerseys again until they came out with the red/white/blue john wall joints.

The Knicks will put their first package together with like 4 firsts and young players and Fournier but they won‚Äôt put RJ down yet 

So they have a staring contest, the Heat are near top of the East approaching the trade deadline, the Knicks are in the 6-8 seed tier of the East, about expected, the Jazz are struggling in the strong west and Mitchell is playing well but overwhelmed.

2022-07-14,raiderjaypussy,"Sure, you make a good point. But we are talking about an FO that did such a good job he took took a small market team, drafted an absurd amount of players who are still in the league on other teams thru draft etc. They've made very little mistakes, and while they could have made a big mistake here, I give them the benefit of the doubt. 

Then the other one is about missing 50% of the time. Yes that is very bad, it also theoretically could be in the past. If he plays 75% of the games in the next 5 years it could not matter. He looked like one of the best in his role when he was playing before injury.  It very easily could've been precautionary both times. Rushing him back his rookie year and last year easily could've put the nail in the coffin for him.

I get the insane risk of him being a bad contract soon, probably one of the riskiest ones in the league atm. But I'm not willing to write it off as certainly being bad, which I feel is the perception from non nugget fans. In my eyes the odds of us sitting here in 10 months talking about MPJ being a 20 ppg 10rpg 40% 3pt shooter for a contender is just as much as him being an extremely overpaid 6th man 12 ppg who is playing behind Gordon, KCP, Bruce Brown or even worse.

He then started making 7+ million in the NBA. If a player out of high school is good enough to be considered a lottery pick, that means the ‚Äúfair‚Äù compensation for their skill is in the millions, not in the hundreds of thousands. Once you include the guarantees in NBA contracts it becomes clear that any player capable of being in the league should be. I also must say it is nothing like the Stepien rule because the Stepien rule is to protect the team from an 8+ year fallout when you trade every pick. It also doesn‚Äôt prevent players from getting paid. Picking a high schooler too high will not ruin a franchise for 8 years, and bust picks already happen pretty often anyway. I don‚Äôt believe in arbitrary rules that prevent a player from making what they are worth, and NBA teams won‚Äôt be forced to draft the players.

It's insanely expensive. If you have a 10 year old, it'd cost about 300ish bucks to get everything you need for your kid and it'd likely be good for 1 season since kids grow so quickly. If you get serious, then you need another few hundo for top end gear. But shit doesn't stop there, you need ice time (like it cost $50 for things like power skating sessions) and travel money cause your kid plays in tournaments all the time.

By the time they're getting serious, things like the skates alone would cost a grand (Grafs were top tier stuff 20 yrs ago, not sure what they would cost now).

I'm personally fine with it too now, Curry won two rings without KD and also a FMVP

now i'd like to see his final years maybe winning 2-3 more rings and over take Lebrons, I think that will be a good end to his career

as far as injury, thats just smth you have to live with, it can happen to any one of the core and it will most likely ruin their chances

besides i also don't think our sub is going to riot, i don't think it's ever been that serious, we're still cordial regarding KD, obviously not so much when it comes to subtweets but i don't use SM so idrc

2022-07-14,DirksSexyBratwurst,"In the playoffs, Herro wasn't even providing offense, so he was benched. Normally, if a player can give you 20PPG, it's worth their defensive shortcomings. The problem is, when you're Herro and you're shots aren't falling, there's no point in leaving you out there. From a regular season perspective no he really didn't get benched often. His most played quarter is the 4th qtr. The trust was there until the playoffs.

The reason he came off the bench for Miami in the regular season is that it's actually better for him as an offensive player. Lowry, Jimmy, and Bam all need the ball too much for him to maximize touches, and Duncan Robinson or Strus don't need the ball at all, neither does Tucker. This means Herro on the bench maximizes Tyler, Duncan, and Strus.


Before Oladipo came back from injury, Miami had virtually zero creators on their bench if they started Herro over Robinson, who I would argue is a worse defender than Herro, because although he has size he is literally incapable of defending without fouling. You can also point to the fact he got close to zero real playoff minutes as evidence.

This means Herro could come off the bench and have much more freedom to actually create for himself, and the bench of Miami full of role players could actually have somebody who is capable of creating. It was a win win. He didn't come off the bench because he couldn't play defense(hed replace Duncan Robinson so that makes no sense). He came off the bench because he can create his own offense.",Heat,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vy8fth/fischer_a_br_p0ll_of_over_two_dozen_nba/,0.9654,0.15,0.788,0.062

And quite frankly, those types of games are more efficient. You‚Äôre getting *free* attempts at scoring. You‚Äôre getting the other team in foul trouble. You‚Äôre keeping your rhythm.

And yes, he sorely lacks leadership skills that Steph/Lebron have. 

But my criticism is about KD on-court: his creation is relatively weak compared to all the other superstars (only Kawhi is worse). And due to his weak creation, he can get swarmed if he's paired with mediocre offensive talents (like it was in OKC/Nets this year). 

On the Warriors, KD did not have that issue given Steph+Klay were giving him so much space that double teams were rarer. And even those double teams were easy to play out of given the increased spacing.

2022-07-14,Lochbriar,"Depends on what you're looking for, I guess. Pat is the clear better defender and I'd imagine he's a better chemistry fit for the Bucks (A fire ant would have better chemistry with a team than Grayson). He also just had the best year of his life from 3, at .395  and if he could continue that, he might be the better starter from a ""Jack-of-all-trades"" type standpoint.

The problem is that Grayson is the definition of knockdown shooter. Take away his rookie year, where he barely played and was adjusting to the pros, and his average is above .400 on more attempts than Pat. Obviously, he went ice cold in the Boston series, and perhaps their length and defense should have drove Grayson out of the rotation, but the ceiling on Grayson is so much higher than Pat.

Its always gross to back Grayson, because he's a shitheel. And I think you could make the argument for Pat, if he's consistently at his highest level. The problem is that even with the best form of Pat, Grayson is still more likely to be the better choice, and Pat has a lot more room to regress than Grayson. To pick Pat, you have to say ""I want the defense, I don't need a three barrage, and I'm not expecting Pat to regress"".",NA,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vyepsn/pat_connaughton_pat_tells_a_story_about_gianniss/,0.8835,0.129,0.811,0.061

2022-07-14,Sultregasome,"You're moving the goalposts here.  I never said that the NBA isn't capitalist.  This is the USA, it's a capitalist system, everything that exists within it is capitalist.  We know that.

I said that the fact that they have a labor union and collective bargaining is socialist, and that if the entirety of the American economy was organized that way it would be called Socialism. That's a lot different than saying that the NBA as a whole is a socialist organization.  Obviously it's not, it really can't be, because we exist in a capitalist economy.

You said that the NBA is the MOST capitalist which is just not true.  True unadulterated capitalism is Walmart or Amazon or McDonald's.  Companies that bring in metric fuck tons of money for their billionaire executive class but, for the most part, have no labor unions or collective bargaining so the labor doesnt see a lick of that wealth.  Their wages are stagnant, their benefits are stagnant, and the company controls all.

Sure, it's a low bar, but the fact that NBA players have at least some negotiating power with the organization automatically makes them less capitalist than the overwhelming majority of industries in this country.  Solely because they can't completely exploit their labor force for profit, which is the concept that capitalism is built on.

Major adult BMI classifications are underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25 to 29.9), and obese (30 or more).[1] When used to predict an individual's health, rather than as a statistical measurement for groups, the BMI has limitations that can make it less useful than some of the alternatives, especially when applied to individuals with abdominal obesity, short stature, or unusually high muscle mass.

Pippen was still an all-star and *more* productive when Jordan was gone. Rodman was the elite defender and rebounder he was both before and after playing with Jordan, he was 2x DPOY before ever wearing a Bulls uniform. Kerr shot **52%** on 3s the non-Jordan years. Obviously most players on the team necesarilly produced more without Jordan since there was a huge hole to fill, but none of them really even took hits in efficiency. Hell, they still won 55 games and lost in game 7 of the second round without Jordan. Not to mention they had a top 2-3 coach of all time.

With that it's a bit misleading because saying ""29 points on 17 fga"" implies 29 points came from just those 17 fga when realistically other shots were also attempted that led to fouls, fta and points independent of the 17 fga.

2022-07-14,sugarpieinthesky,"> NBA I totally get, one year isn‚Äôt massive but still makes a difference (cases like Patrick Baldwin stand out), but I think the NFL would be crazy to go younger

Honest question: which outcome is better for Patrick Baldwin in the long run?  Go pro after senior year of High School, get taken in the top 5 picks, by OKC, or Orlando, or Houston, or the Kings, and so on, or, go to college, play horrifically, and plummet down the draft boards, but get picked by the Golden State Warriors, the team that, if he is talented, is most likely to correctly develop that talent, put him in the best possible position to succeed, and will pay him if he's great?  

See, I agree with Draymond: we talk about how these young guys fail all the time, but we never talk about how the team failed to develop them.  So many times, a young guy gets picked by a bad organization, is in the system for a year, the team drafts someone who does  the same thing he does the very next year, both players compete for limited minutes and both canabalize each other's careers.  

That used to be the dubs, Larry Hughes was first, then they drafted Jason Richardson to do the same thing, despite never having developed Hughes, then, they drafted Monta Ellis despite never having developed Jrich, then they drafted Steph Curry, which is when they finally got it right.  I remember trading a first round pick to Philly to get Larry Hughes, I thought he was legit, but he was here for about two seconds before Jrich replaced him at the same job.

RJ shot 40% from 3 when we were the 4 seed so the potential is there (mostly C&S and not creating his own shot though).

By all accounts he's an extremely hard worker too so I have faith that he will improve. And I'm excited to see him with a PG next season that can penetrate and facilitate.

There were a ton of busts in the 2000s though out of high school.  For every Kobe, LeBron & Garnett, there are probably 5 names of kids you never knew that busted out of HS or didn't get drafted at all and never signed.

And what about the kids that go in the second round, end up busting and get paid essentially peanuts compared to what they would have gotten over the course of their whole life by going to college for 4 years?

2022-07-14,SapereAudeNothing,"I mean it was a poorly built team, even with two superstars, combined with unfortunate circumstances. Kyrie out of the lineup for most of the year + Harris injury + Harden trade makes it pretty hard to build a cohesive team.  

Hindsight be damned, Marks & co should have kept faith in the original vision of building a deep team around KD + Kyrie. A strong GM with a vision can hold off the wolves (KD+Kyrie's agents or whatever) and reject the all-in gamble of trading for Harden and realize even with Kyrie's unpredictabilities, if you treat him right and establish a level relationship with him, he's more or less fine.   

Yeah, you still miss Kyrie last season to being unvaccinated (though they should have stood from the beginning and let him play home games imo, either way irrelevant) but you'd still be in a better position today with a contending team.  Jarrett Allen would continue his impressive trajectory, LeVert would be a stellar sixth man (or a trade piece for a better fit maybe), etc.  

I can't remember the cap implications, but if they could have gone over for Spencer, they should have went all in for it. Believe in the dudes that you develop.

Keegan would not be given the same slack if he played poorly, and is almost expected to be the best player on the court in most of these summer league games.

KOBY altman on drafting Sexton : ""We talk about it all the time,"" Altman said. ""With our culture here, we want to bring in guys with great attitude, great work ethic, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîguys who really want to be here. Collin embodies all of that, and he's going to add to that culture right away.""

Koby a few months ago: He, in a lot of ways, was the start of not only the rebuild, but the culture that we have in place now,‚Äù Altman said of Sexton. ‚ÄúWe asked him to do a tall task. Four straight Finals, and now, we‚Äôre sorta starting anew, and he was the start of that. And we wanted to have a place that thrived from great attitude, great work ethic, and somebody that really wanted to be in Cleveland, Ohio, and help us get back to those heights. He embodied every part of that, and he still does today.

‚ÄúAnd so, he in a lot of ways is the reason why we‚Äôre here, because he started that culture for us. That (attitude of) every single day, I‚Äôm gonna get better. I‚Äôm gonna bring my hard hat, I‚Äôm gonna work on my skills; I don‚Äôt care about the results if I‚Äôm incrementally getting better and pushing this franchise forward. He‚Äôs enormously important to us, he‚Äôs been enormously important to us. To lose him, you can see throughout the year why we missed him or how we missed him. So, we owe Collin a great debt of gratitude for what he‚Äôs done, the work he‚Äôs put in and he continues to put in. An important part of his team.‚Äù

If you like different ethnic cuisine you'll have a good time. Definitely have ramen (at anywhere except Kinton, and even Kinton is better than most places in most other cities; sansotei is a good chain you can find anywhere), definitely have Korean (Daldongnae is a respectable chain, there's better places but further north in the city). Most of the best restaurants in the core are on College, Dundas, and Queen, with some decent ones on bloor/the danforth too). The best east Asian food is often up north in North York or even further north/east in Markham or Scarborough. The best Indian food is outside the city in Brampton, or in the western part of the city in Etobicoke, little India in the east end is also okay, the core is meh for Indian.

If you want restaurant/cafe names: Konjiki, Rhum Corner, Drom Taberna, Mizzica, Le Gourmand, Antler, Marben, Birriera Volo, Debe's, The Caledonian, Bar Vendetta, Bellwoods, Gyubee, Zakkushi, Beast, Blood Brothers, Aloette (Alo is more expensive), Allwyns is okay for a chain, PAI, Fourth Man in the Fire, Sabai Sabai, MIMI, Gouter, Buk Chang Dong, Buca, Little Sister, Han Ba Tang, Shoushin (expensive), Pho Saigon St, Amadeus, Dejavu, Cho Sun OK, Kinka and Nome Izakaya are good for casual.",NA,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vyfsre/vince_carter_on_broussards_comments_about_toronto/,0.994,0.197,0.779,0.024

2022-07-14,TheGoldenLance,"That‚Äôs just not how series work though. You can‚Äôt just add the game and act like nothing changes in that context. The nuggets ran out of gas but they largely ran out of gas because they went down 0-2 in a game they win 90% of the time.

I agree the Lakers were a better team but you were also riding on EXTREME outlier shooting luck from AD and he was getting absolutely dominated by Jokic all series, even when Jokic was at 5 fouls (frankly, because of market incentives, if we‚Äôre being real). It was so bad that they had to switch up their rotations to hide AD from Jokic and match him up with Plumlee. The series ended before Jokic could really crack the next code, but if you‚Äôve followed the nuggets in the playoffs before, Jokic has a tendency to kind of fuck around at the start of series and then just completely take over and dominate schematically. He did that twice that same playoff run with the double 3-1 comebacks, he did it against Portland in 2021 (also had a terrible game 1), and this year against the warriors we got absolutely torched in games 1 and 2, and then played them ridiculously close in games 3-5, losing them by 4 total points. It was more competitive than any team played GSW over a 3 game stretch this year and it happened because Jokic basically cracked the code on their schemes and on draymond, and they had to pour everything they had into knocking him out with Monte Morris as his #2.

Like I said I tend to lean towards Denver just not quite being ready to beat Lebron, they were too young and at too much of a rest disadvantage, but the series would have looked completely different if AD didn‚Äôt convert such a low percentage shot on that play. I mean Denver looked even more cooked against Utah and the Clippers than they did against the Lakers, the difference was that shot going in.",Nuggets,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vyk0ke/wojnarowski_kentavious_caldwellpope_has_agreed_on/,-0.0415,0.096,0.81,0.094

In Canada we already had that insecurity that stars didn't take us seriously, and that we weren't a destination, and then watching McGrady walk and then Carter quit on us so publicly, I carried that resentment for a long time.  But a fair look at the Raptors management and coaching from that time meant I had to acknowledge they shared a lot of the blame.  By the time the 20th season rolled around I was able to separate the man from that time, and I was able to enjoy him after that.

2022-07-14,MotoMkali,"He's overrated as an offensive player generally. He never really has driven super efficient offences. But he's probably around 12-15 would be my guess.

So the 11 I mentioned probably ahead (at least peak Dwade though ofc you could argue that with longevity KD is better). Though he's maybe still currently better than Jokic. So I'd say 10 at a stretch?  9 as the highest you can go if you ignore pre merger players (kareems offence post merger is still good enough to be ahead of KD). 

Then like Kobe, West, Barkley, Dirk, both Malones, Playoff Reggie Miller (2nd greatest scorer ever), Hakeem. I have him near the top of this group along with Hakeem and Dirk.

This isn't an attempt at a holistic analysis but my best attempt off the top of my head. I flip flop around on my specific rankings on these guys daily because its hard to say how good they were at their peaks compared to others.

Especially the guys in the 90s. The league was kind of super weak from like 94 onwards.

He's always been a hater, and I think that held him back more than anything. His personality was not easy to sell.

He was offered all the opportunities to sell his likeness as Jordan and Shaq had; and made similar money from NBA contracts. Jordan never made more than $4M/yr from the Bulls, until his last 2 seasons. He's not even in the top 100 highest paid NBA players. Yet he's a multi-billionaire and Shaq is worth almost half a billion. Chuck is just making excuses.

It's true basketball wasn't as popular in the 80's, but he was also offered some of the greatest investment and business opportunities in modern history. $1M in 1985 is worth $4-5M today, inflation adjusted.

If he stuck $1M in the stock market in the 1987 and left it; it would be worth about $200M today. He's also a horrible gambler.

2022-07-14,joe124013,">In the early 90s the Bulls were not expected to win because they never had a dominant center. No one expected a guard to simply dominate like Jordan did. 

This wasn't true at all. Especially with Detroit winning prior to the Bulls. It was partially the narrative through all the 80's, but the bigger thing then was that Jordan couldn't win because he scored too much, not because he was a guard. 

>The perception was Pippen never really did anything without Jordan and when he had his chance to run the team during Jordan's retirement, he faded. This sealed his reputation as a sidekick. Kind of like how it would be weird to say ""Of course Giannis won the title, he had Middleton, an all-star!"" 

This is also not true. I mean Pippen finished 3rd in MVP voting the first year Jordan was gone, 7th the second year when Jordan returned at the end, and 5th the first year of the second three peat. Also a bunch of 1st and 2nd team all NBA selections. Rodman was also 3rd team All NBA the year before he joined the Bulls, nobody thought he was past his prime, they just through San Antonio didn't wanna put up with his weirdness. And Kukoc was treated like a big deal when he came over for sure. Hell, part of the friction Pippen had with the Bulls was because he was jealous of Kukoc's role and contract.   


They weren't a ""super team"" in that one HoF player in or near his prime didn't sign or get traded there, but compared to the other teams in the 90's, they had far more talent just from the Jordan/Pippen duo. The only other teams you could consider close would be the Houston teams after they got Drexler (who did win a title), the Jazz with Malone and Stockton (and tbh I've always thought of Stockton as more of a compiler-a very good player who was extremely durable and consistent but not a ""great"" player) and the Magic with Shaq/Penny (who beat the Bulls the year Jordan came back at the end). Drexler had...Terry Porter? Jerome Kersey? Ewing had Starks and Mason? Robinson had Sean Elliot and Rodman? Barkley's been mentioned. The other big east teams were the Pacers with Reggie, Jalen, and Smits, Miami with Zo and Hardaway.",NA,-1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vygoo9/todd_charles_barkley_on_bradley_beals_251_million/,-0.8189,0.069,0.841,0.089

Someone has to come before and pave the way. In the past I've often wished I'd been born earlier, or later, or to a family that had more to offer me. In the past few years I've learned that this kind of thinking only leads to darkness.

You can't change your circumstances. Period. Accept yourself and your environment. And when I say accept, I mean *fully accept it, without judgement.* Only then can you truly step back and ask ""Now what's the best thing for me to do given who I am and where I am at?""

I'll never be a historically recognized physicist, though I probably have the brain for it and I love my physics hobby. I will probably never be an internationally recognized AI expert, even though I work on AI and I have a deep passion for it, and I keep rediscovering old ideas that have already been tried (and worked). But what I can do, right here, right now, is be the best me that I can be, constantly endeavoring to better myself and do the best with what I have and where I'm at, and face the challenges I have in front of me head on with courage and resilience. And furthermore, I can *love* doing it.

2022-07-14,MotoMkali,"As a side note the league being really weak in the 90s is kind of why I think MJs 6 titles are super overrated. Magic and Bird didn't try to extend their primes the way MJ, Kareem, Lebron, Kobe, Duncan and even KD and Steph have. Bird was 35 when he retired but was still performing at an all-star level. He could have tried extending his prime a bit. Had len bias not died or magic continued playing perhaps bird would have tried to do so.

Then a series of weak drafts in the late 80s and early 90s led the league devoid of prime players in the late 90s and rapid expansion led to weak teams which led to fairly easy rings imo. Ofc winning 6 rings is no easy feat but I feel like it often gets overstated. Especially since Worthy and Scott got injured in 91 which led to that being a fairly easy ring for MJ. Then the next best player he gets in the playoffs after bird and magic leave at least in their primes is probably barkley who whilst great isn't quite on the level of KD, Dirk, Duncan, Garnett, Steph, Kobe, Wade etc. That have dominated the 2000s so far.

Nobody's forcing anyone. Prospects can play in leagues that pay them, like LaMelo did. Plus, with the NIl rule, NCAA players can get money too. 

>¬†I‚Äôm not in favor of screwing over 18 year olds to protect GMs from being dumb, they can learn to not draft guys that are risky or they can pay the price.
