2022-04-17,SPC54,"Fair bit to unpack here:

- Sixers totally stalled our offence just by rebounding well and not turning the ball over, if they can continue to do that well our offence takes a *massive* hit.

- Raptors looked a little off tonight, particularly in the first half. If nothing else, I’d say the increased physicality and comparative lack of experience bit them in the ass.

- Scottie was pretty good, I *really* hope his foot/ankle’s gonna be alright.

- Gary… not so much, if he continues to play like *that* we’ve got no chance whatsoever. 

- Fred getting those 2 fouls early on also killed us, if he isn’t being aggressive on defence that *really* hurts our ability to force TO’s

- Harden shot poorly but still made good plays, combined with our bad rebounding performance we didn’t really deal with him well.

- Tyrese Maxey has proven to be a problem, if he scores efficiently like he did tonight it doesn’t Matter how well we defend Harden.

- Tobias Harris also played pretty well, at least from the eye test.

- Doc playing Paul Reed at the 5 when Embiid sat is an alarming adjustment, in my totally unbiased opinion those minutes should go to someone like DeAndre Jordan. (/s)

- I hope our players getting hurt isn’t going to be a trend, or the remaining games aren’t gonna go well.

- Refs were fucking terrible, but they usually are and complaining about them is a total waste of time.

TL;DR: Sixers came out prepared and played really well, Raptors did the opposite and got punched in the mouth, figuratively & literally.

It’ll be interesting to see how we come out on Monday, given our history with Game 1’s I can’t say I’m terribly surprised by tonight’s outcome, only the margin.

Lots of stuff we can improve on, but then again, if Scottie got seriously injured we’re boned.

See you then, Philly.

^Please ^let ^Scottie ^be ^okay

It’s why I was so excited when we initially got him because I thought this is what he always was (he was better in LAC no doubt). Now that the sixers have two great perimeter creators, along with embiid’s improved creation ability, I think he can really thrive. 

No he’s not gonna shoot 50+% from deep of course but the WILLINGNESS to either shoot it quick, drive or move the rock is so key. He had a rocky start after the harden trade but for the last month he’s been exactly what we’ve asked of him. And his ability to get his own look is so much better when he’s not forcing it. Like he can have it best of both worlds if he really wants, he’ll still have opportunities to get a few of those looks but if he tries to do it 6-8 times a game that just isn’t it. 

I want tobias to be on a sixers deep run playoff team so bad, he’s so obviously a cool ass dude that everyone likes and at this point he’s been through it with us TBH. It’s his 4th year here. Hope he keeps it up!

1a. A balk is when you

1b. Okay well listen. A balk is when you balk the

1c. Let me start over

1c-a. The defender is not allowed to do a motion to the, uh, shooter, that prohibits the shooter from doing, you know, just trying to shoot the ball. You can’t do that.

1c-b. Once the defender is in the stretch, he can’t be over here and say to the shooter, like, “I’m gonna get ya! I’m gonna box you out! You better watch your butt!” and then just be like he didn’t even do that.

1c-b(1). Like, if you’re about to box out and then don’t box out, you have to still box out. You cannot not box out. Does that make any sense?

1c-b(2). You gotta be, shooting motion of the ball, and then, until you just box out.

1c-b(2)-a. Okay, well, you can have the ball up here, like this, but then there’s the balk you gotta think about.

1c-b(2)-b. Fairuza Balk hasn’t been in any movies in forever. I hope she wasn’t typecast as that racist lady in American History X.

1c-b(2)-b(i). Oh wait, she was in The Waterboy too! That would be even worse.

1c-b(2)-b(ii). “get in mah bellah” – Adam Water, “The Waterboy.” Haha, classic…

1c-b(3). Okay seriously though. A balk is when the pretender makes a movement that, as determined by, when you do a move involving the basketball court and field of view.

2022-04-17,TheRed_Knight,"JP.  WELCOME.  TOO.  THE.  FUCKING.  SHOW!  Helluva playoff debut, white hot shooting, good enough defense, mostly good decision making and a some really nice passing  

Give Jokic the MVP rn idgaf, idk how he carried this squad to 48 win season, and please get him some fucking help, man deserves it.  

Tempos gonna be a big part of this series, Denver wants to play more half court to half court, while the Warriors want to run to tire Jokic et al. out, Warriors won that battle today and dictated the pace, gassing  out Denver, even though they managed to keep up for the first quarter, they just got ran out of the gym over the course of the game.  As an aside the Warriors might be the best conditioned team in the league, i get tired watching them lol.  

There isnt much else too say about the rest of the Denver team, they mostly just looked ok minus Gordon who looked cooked, biggest issue is most of them are minus defenders, cant have that many minus defenders with a C who isnt that great at defense and expect to win in the playoffs 

Good teams close quarters, Warriors closed the 2nd on a 17-4 run, 3rd on a 14-3 run, exactly what youd want too see, especially with Curry not shooting well.

Curry shot like shit (minus the 4th quarter) which was to be expected, but the Nuggets were so concerned with letting him getting anything that it created a plethora of easy baskets for the rest of the team (and single coverage for a red hot Poole)

Im stilled confused as to why teams try and double Curry when Dray/Iggy are on the court, it so rarely works out and they usually end up giving up free buckets 

Wiggins quietly had a really good game, good defense, good rotations, rebounded well, didnt force it on offense, passed and cut well, made FT's etc

Playoff Draymond and is a different beast, took a quarter too get going but once he did he dominated, way more impact than the boxscore would indicate

Best overall Klay game of the season, played within the offense and didnt force it, played good defense, good rotations, etc

That was a Prime Boogie ejection right there, forces Jokic too play extra minutes, selfish and dumb

This way they get raw exposure. Sure, most won't think anything of it, but they might end up reaching some like-minded individuals who would have never heard of this cause otherwise. And they get more clicks on youtube videos for ad revenue just by virtue of the curious on-lookers (like myself) wondering what this is all about.

2022-04-17,BeautifulAndStoned,"Everyone is going to want to talk about Mitchell's shooting but I think he figured it out in the 2nd half.  He played really well defensively tonight, made a lot of smart plays.  

Dallas is playing so slow.  They don't run that much, so the Jazz just get a take foul and play half court defense every time.  In crunch time they were playing Bertans or Kleber at the 5 and playing grind it out half court offense it's kind of incredible to watch.  Also I'm not sure what the point of having Green is going to be if he's just standing in the corner.  He needs to be running to be useful.

They're not really taking advantage of the Jazz defensive deficiencies.  If the Jazz can run that Clarkson and Bogdanovic lineup and not get punished that's going to be hard to beat. That takes a huge load off Royce.  Really encouraging to see him keep his legs and play well in crunch time.

Finney smith played really well but they didn't really give him much to do. One possession he had Bogdanovic on him and he's not even in a triple threat position.  He only put the ball in the floor like 4 times and made a great play every time.  Dallas offense very predictable.  Brunson/Dinwiddie taking turns running high pnr.  Those guys are playing really well but there isn't a lot of movement. A whole lot of standing around waiting for an open 3.

I can see why people talk about their defense, they're doing a great job defending the 3.  but I can't help but think a lot of that is just everyone playing small ball now.  They really miss Porzingis at the rim.  Other than Powell the whole Dallas team is Charmin soft in the frontcourt.  Bogie iso attacking the basket in the first half was automatic.  The whole team was getting to the rim at will in the 2nd half, especially on Bertans.

Whiteside on the 2nd team gives the Jazz a level of physical dominance through 48 minutes that is hard to match. They're doing a good job defending the 3-pt but frontcourt is brutal.",NA,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/u55l53/post_game_thread_the_utah_jazz_10_defeat_the/,0.9938,0.203,0.716,0.082

Durant couldn't win a ring in OKC, so he went to the Warriors, and everyone was unhappy.  When/if the Kings finally make the playoffs and end their streak, they are likely to celebrate like they just won the chip as the should and the media will poke fun at them which is silly.  The We Believe Warriors beating Dallas in Round 1 2007 was pretty close to as much fun as winning in 2015 and 2017 and probably more fun than 2018 if I am being honest.

BLM protests were called useless and for idiots repeatedly by a sect of people.  There are other extreme examples I could make but I don’t want to blow this up. 


This isn’t a cause I’ll do it for, but that line of thought is an awful reason to not protest. Things don’t change without bringing awareness to problems and being vocal that people disagree with how things are. You don’t protest for things to change the following day, you do it because you believe it’s worth ridicule and punishment for your cause.

> Paul has lost his last 12 playoffs games when Foster has been on the officiating crew. The one time Paul’s team won a game with Foster installed as a referee came when Paul was held out while he was in the league’s Health and Safety protocol during Game 2 of the Western Conference Finals. Phoenix won that game on the infamous ‘Valley Oop’ dunk by Deandre Ayton at the buzzer.

> Now Scott Foster is officiating the biggest game of Paul’s career in Game 6 of the 2021 NBA Finals.
> If the Suns lose, their season is over, and so is Paul’s best chance at an NBA championship

2022-04-17,ilive12,"There's nobody who's a 38 point every night player, at least not since MJ. 

But Maxey has proven to show up in the moment, and also already shown he is capable of hitting 38 in the past, there won't be many sixers fans that see this game as a fluke or unrepeatable. I'd think it would be more of a fluke if Tobi scored more than 35 over Tyrese, he's absolutely capable of stepping up the spotlight if you've watched a lot of his games.

And actually if you really think about it, this game is not that surprising given Toronto's gameplan. They basically drew it up to double and triple Embiid and Harden all game and make any other player step up to score. That's a key reason why Tobi & Maxey had good games, neither Embiid nor Harden got into turnover trouble from the doubles, and Maxey and Tobi had some of the easiest buckets of their life. 

Toronto basically forced us to make Maxey the 1st option. If you look at the games where Embiid has sat this season, Maxey is scoring 24ppg. He's absolutely up to the task to put up big numbers if we need to run the offense through him, and seeing as the Raptors basically forced us to do that, it is not surprising at all that he went off. 

Again, not saying he will average 38 for the series, but if this is the gameplan the raps keep running, him averaging 25+ would not surprise me even a little bit.",76ers,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/u5bjbd/post_game_thread_the_philadelphia_76ers_10_start/,-0.6556,0.052,0.873,0.075

In order for that to happened, the Mavs had to beat the Spurs and the Warriors had to lose to the Pelicans without Ingram (and CJ who played a few minutes). Both games were happening at the same time too. I understand playing Luka to potentially get the 3rd seed to start the game, but when Luka was injured at the end of the 3rd quarter, the Warriors had a 30 point lead over the Pelicans. I doubt the Warriors would have blown that lead and if they did, the Mavs already had a comfortable lead over the Spurs too.

2022-04-17,Existing_Poem_7858,"The Warriors are stronger and anything but 4-0 or 4-1 would be a surprise. They have a very deep roster. The craziest of all is the tenth player from the Warriors in the rank of Denver's fourth-fifth. The Refs have released a more aggressive game for GSW BUT even with fair criteria it would be similar. Thay are much better in this type of playoff game. 

Denver has no chance with Malone's rigid perception of basketball. The man has some delusional ideas. Also an unprecedentedly stupid decision not to chase Utah or Dallas harder.

Malone should play starting line up with Jokic-Zeke-Gordon-Bones-Monte. At least he would get a LOT of running. He's totally delusional if he thinks he's defending something with old Jeff and Barton. He will push his veterans even though he will lose 4-0, an incredibly old-fashioned coach. 

If nothing else he should try with the younger players around Jokic. No way with old Green and Barton defending something much. He'd rather lose 4-0 than put Zeke or Cancar instead of old Jeff-- who can barely run 🙄 

I've never seen a worse defense in a playoff game than Jeff and Barton play - they almost don't exist. Barton's stats are the biggest delusion I've ever seen in a single game. The Denver FO has screwed up this year but at least they need to stop with faith in Barton, as well as with many veterans.

Jokic needs 3-D players but they bring him old Jeff, give Barton a lot of trust again, bring Facu super-undersized guard etc. Unseen misunderstandings of modern basketball from the Denver FO and Malone. They have a diamond and they have been doing everything else terribly for several years. 

It is over, even i am always super optimist.

Malone will play the same, he won't even change old Jeff or reduce Barton's minutes. This playoff will be just for Barton' s stats, fucking unbelievable 🙂",NA,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/u5e1iz/post_game_thread_the_golden_state_warriors_10/,0.956,0.143,0.759,0.098

2022-04-17,Muggi,"It’s not that uncommon for him over the course of the last few seasons. The reason is he doesn’t force the issue against contact.

The obvious comparison is Embiid, and here’s the difference IMO: Jokic gets contact on his arms when he gathers, he tends to “bounce” off it - he adjusts. Embiid doesn’t - he goes toward contact or he adjusts AFTER blatant contact. It basically forces refs to make a call because he heads directly FOR the contact once he feels it or the opportunity for it - Jokic doesn’t. Jokic tries to avoid it or alter his own shot AWAY from contact once he feels it. It’s honestly the same reason Harden gets calls - he forces refs to make them by heading TO defenders contact when they’re out of position.

Every big gets hit on a high percent of their shots. What happens when they get hit has a huge impact on wether they go to the line or not.",76ers,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/u5e1iz/post_game_thread_the_golden_state_warriors_10/,0.7351,0.057,0.929,0.013

2022-04-17,AB_Gambino,"I love Ant, believe me, he is the **future** of this franchise and will undoubtedly claim the spot as the #1 player, potentially top 2 all-time Timberwolf along with KG. THAT'S how much I love Ant and have confidence in him.

But KAT is the best player on this team and it isn't even close. If you put up 25/10/4 on 53/41/82 shooting splits, you are one of the very best players in the league; and that's KAT. He's 7th in the league in PER, on a team that was 10 games over .500, won their play-in and now clearly proven they're going to make this a series.

Karl-Anthony-Towns is simply better, more skilled, and more experienced than anyone else (besides Pat Bev on the experience part).

Anthony Edwards **will be** the better player at their absolute peak, I'm confident of this. We have to remember, KAT is forever limited by the fact he is a 7ft Center in a league that has always required a good ball handler (even during Kareem/Hakeem/Shaq). Big men can't initiate the offense every time down the floor like a guard/wing, they can't dribble drive and create from a pick and roll as efficiently as a guard/wing. Guards/wings typically defend more positions due to their versatility, and ultimately will have the ball in their hands when it comes time to make decisions.

Anthony Edwards, at 20 years old, has clearly proven that all the tools are there. He is an absolute **lock** when it comes to talent. It is now a matter of hard work, years of experience, and the will to be great. He has shown, so far, to have all of that. Time will tell.

In 4-5 years he will be a top 5 player in the league.",Timberwolves,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/u57rbg/highlight_kat_obliterates_jj/,0.997,0.217,0.771,0.012

His biggest issue was not hitting shots BUT the shots he took, the confidence he took them and the form and fluidity his game all screamed…he’s got potential.

You could see that in the game today - even though they lost by 13, only one of their 5 bench guys who got minutes had a negative +/-. 

The Grizzlies were genuinely very good in the regular season and had some genuine issues last night that were specific to Minnesota. They couldn’t really figure out how to guard KAT with their starting rotation. The Wolves shot 40% from 3, while the Grizzles shot 25% from 3. Ant got hot and went shot-for-shot with Ja.

2022-04-17,ForkBombGoBoom,"> Sixers totally stalled our offence just by rebounding well and not turning the ball over, if they can continue to do that well our offence takes a massive hit.

Yep. Weird to see from the Sixers, they never emphasize rebounding and typically have high turnovers.

> Raptors looked a little off tonight, particularly in the first half. If nothing else, I’d say the increased physicality and comparative lack of experience bit them in the ass.

Raptors were not swarming Embiid the way they usually do, but also Embiid just didn't have the ball much. Sixers can't be beaten if 3 guys not named Embiid get 20+. I agree this game looked bizarre from the Raptors, it's like they were moving in slow motion compared to our previous games. Or maybe the Sixers just stepped up. A week off was big for Embiid and Harden, who have both played a lot of minutes all season.

> Doc playing Paul Reed at the 5 when Embiid sat is an alarming adjustment, in my totally unbiased opinion those minutes should go to someone like DeAndre Jordan.

Mmhmm. If Doc's secret playoff adjustment is playing Reed, Sixers might contend for a title.",76ers,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/u5bjbd/post_game_thread_the_philadelphia_76ers_10_start/,0.9052,0.132,0.79,0.078

Just judging by where it’s gone so far though, there are some MAJOR differences in plot and it’s absolutely for the better. Major characters throughout multiple seasons have entirely different arcs. 

Big reason why I haven’t gotten through it is because how attached I got to a lot of those book characters and just how different their fate and overall tone is. 

It’s just down right better and makes way more sense narratively. Cornwell takes liberties with history but never to the degree the show has.

I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;"" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season.""

2022-04-17,HisExcellency20,">Sixers totally stalled our offence just by rebounding well and not turning the ball over, if they can continue to do that well our offence takes a massive hit.


The Raptors beat the Sixers last game by severely outrebounding the Sixers and turning them over. The Raptors are very good at getting turnovers and while we're not bad at protecting the ball, we obviously aren't usually *that* good. And we're a very bad rebounding team, especially allowing a ton of offensive rebounds. It was my main concern going into the game. If we can continue to not give the Raptors a ton of second chance shots we can control the series. 


By the time I realized this game was being played on ESPN 2 (thanks for letting me know that when the score was fucking 17-10 btw ESPN) Fred was already saddled with two fouls. 


Harden shot well if you don't count all the times he was blocked/s. Seriously though he played well this game and shot the three exceptionally well. You guys are probably the worst team in the playoffs for Harden. When you switch a 6'7"" wing dude with another 6'8"" wing you start to wonder what the point even was. Good for Embiid, but it's hard to drive past bigs when you're not facing any lol.",76ers,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/u5bjbd/post_game_thread_the_philadelphia_76ers_10_start/,0.2812,0.098,0.826,0.076

No way that Utah does it unless the Jazz implode and Gobert wants out, plus the Hawks (and Mavs) could offer a competitive deal and the Jazz would be more receptive to trading Gobert to the East. I do think that Wiggins + Kuminga + Moody is probably the highest potential deal they could get, and the fit with Mitchell would be good.

2022-04-17,Papacu81,"Pro athletes in the US specially got too much spoiled with time, both the athletes and the public assume this is some kind of a important ""event"" because the price seats are expensive, the ""showtime"" mentality and etc.. in the end, we're talking about nothing more than a bunch of sacks of meat running after a ball, it's not really something special. I love the sport and I am self aware about this, basketball is just a physical activity, regardless of how much fireworks are involved. 

Saying that, no wonder the players stop caring about competing because that notion got lost with time, which is a shame. Players at the end of the bench are overpaid, the player association got too ""empowered"", etc.. players stop caring, they just cash-in and complain when things don't go their way (the Ben Simmons of the world). I think the only reason why the Wolves are showing so much emotion, also Trae Young with his (awesome) theatrics, they do it because of lack of maturity, then you have the Bucks and Suns completely focused on winning because they represent the other extreme of maturity. Many teams are lost in that middle-ground were ""if I win or lose, who cares, I am still earning millions"" and I honestly can't judge that sentiment, humans tends to be accommodated",Lakers,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/u52hau/jj_reddick_on_timberwolves_winning_for_all_the/,0.8158,0.117,0.784,0.099

2022-04-17,Noah__Webster,"I'm not sure what type of houses they had, but I grew up around chicken farms. If you look at a map of broiler chicken farms in America, there's just like a solid band of dots that represent 20 farms that runs across north Alabama and Georgia, where I grew up. So I was around it a lot. It felt like just about every random country road you drove down you'd find a few chicken farms every so often.

The ones I'm familiar with are broiler farms, meaning they are grown for meat, not eggs. I'm not sure what type of houses this happened in. Theirs might be different. 

The largest farm I've been on also held ~300k birds at a time, so nothing like the 5 million of that farm. 

But the houses I went in were always trying to be as air tight as possible. You did this to keep heat in early on, and then later you used something called ""tunnel ventilation"". It kinda worked like a big air conditioner. At one end of the house, you would have things called a cool cell pad. They were kinda like the cool coils that air runs over in an AC. 

You would have air intake coming in the front of the house, and it would run through the cool cells and then you would have a large bank of exhaust fans at the other end of the house, and it would pull the hot air out the back. Also kinda similar to something like a PC where you (typically) want ""negative pressure"" where most of the air is being pushed out. 

Keeping things as close to air tight as possible helped. And the ""wind tunnel"" effect was crazy. If you weren't careful, the door would get ripped out of your hand and slammed shut. 

But you could choose to not run these intake/exhaust fans, and they had flaps on them that would stay shut when they weren't running. 

When you first got the birds, you would run brooders and seal up the house as tight as possible to keep it warm and reduce your utility bill. You'd normally shoot for like 85-90 degrees iirc, and you had to be able to maintain that in like a 20k+ square foot house. So you definitely had to keep it air tight. It's kinda like a home where you want to keep it insulated as well as possible, both to control for heat and cold. You just have more control. 

So my assumption is that there was definitely the option for lots ventilation.

2022-04-17,HornyHindu,"Well, they're not really wrong despite the downvotes... 

% of FGs 0-3 feet (ie at the rim):

 Curry: 12.0%

Morant: 33.2%

% of FGs 3 -10 feet:

Curry: 13.4%

Morant: 29.1%

% FGs 3PTs:

Curry: 61.3%

Morant: 21.8%


Morant drives to the rim for the majority of his shots (whether at the rim to near the paint) and Curry takes majority of shots from 3PT... you can argue despite the fact Curry rarely drives to the rim, he even when he does he doesn't get calls... But Morant should be getting far more FTs based on how often he does.

>	Farms faced with the need to kill so many birds turn to recommendations by the American Veterinary Medical Association. Even as it has developed methods to kill the poultry quickly, the association acknowledges its techniques “may not guarantee that the deaths the animals face are painless and distress free.” Veterinarians and U.S. Department of Agriculture officials also typically oversee the process.

Yes, you already said that. I didn't disagree.

> But there are other players on the team

Agree. One less player than before (Ingles) and one who is known not to pass the ball (Mitchell). Which means the behaviour of the remaining (mainly Conley) is what one may have to watch/explain going forward.

BTW: I figure 15 assists in the entire game is lowish; Conley only had 3. JC isn't much of a passer. Maybe Bogdan to be monitored too",NA,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/u55p02/luka_considering_all_the_timelines_that_wouldve/,0.4753,0.076,0.875,0.049

Most chicken farms will use a similar suffocation method to mass kill chickens, or also commonly used is to hang the chickens upside down and then have them pass over a pool of water that's got a current running through it.  Their heads pass through the water and the current knocks them out so they can be killed painlessly, but some chickens will tuck their heads in and miss the water entirely and then have to be killed while conscious.

2022-04-17,BigMik_PL,"JJ really needs to settle the fuck down. 

This has been a moronic take. Fans wanting players to care doesn't mean we expect wild celebration after every single regular season win. 

It means we don't want to pay $400 for a ticket to watch D-Wade mail it in for 3 quarters and only start trying in the 4th if the game is close enough. That is the problem, not high stakes playoff games. It's disheartening to scrape enough money as a college student to go watch your favorite player only for him to just kind of cruise around the court a bit for most of the game.

We want players to continue to improve and not quit on their teams because the market is not big enough for them and there is no more money to make there so it's time for a trade. 

That's what people are asking for not because the teams weren't celebrating wins hard enough. 

Once the big money during and post Jordan era poured in the NBA turned into a total business where everything became so money centric the game of basketball became secondary. The rules were changed so the game can make more money, owners taking advantage of players, players revolting and taking matters into their own hands, no more loyalty anywhere. Honor and ambition became secondary too because players realized they can just all band together and make each other more money by being NBA Champs. Rivalries are dead because the next season you can literally be teammates so why start anything.

That is the problem and fucking Timberwolves celebrating making the playoffs with a parade ain't fixing shit.",76ers,-3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/u52hau/jj_reddick_on_timberwolves_winning_for_all_the/,-0.3032,0.11,0.776,0.114
