2022-06-03,moral_panic_,"Yup. I've been on reddit for over a decade now (I'm sad about it too) on various accounts. Redditors have always had this smug superiority to other social media. I remember when shitting on YouTube comments was the thing. Reddit is genuinely no better than those sites once a sub gets above a certain size. Now to be fair, smaller communities here really can be fun to interact with, but there is a critical mass that forms where everything just becomes terrible in the same way twitter is. 

There's this switch that gets flipped and suddenly everyone is trying to dunk on comments rather than having any sort of a charitable interpretation of what people are saying. Don't even get me started on the mouthbreathers who assume that any comment that doesn't explicitly condemn the action or thing they are talking about is therefore endorsing it. Gosh.

2022-06-03,dgarrad,"The podcast era has basically exposed modern mainstream sports media for being hot take garbage that actually adds nothing to the conversation. 

I admittedly have not consumed a lot of like First take over the last 5ish years except the meme clips. But the few times I've got the programs while passing time the arguments devolve instantly into things like legacy, basic stat analysis, how much more one player/team wanted the win, etc... Nothing that actually improves the discourse of the sport.

While if I put on a podcast like Thinking basketball, Lowe Post, Dunc'd on, fuck even No Dunks or the BS pod the basketball conversations are actually deep, use more then box scores to analyze the game, and give understanding for their points in depth. 

It really is incredible how a sport can be so poorly covered by the medium that gets all the money thrown at it while the medium that anyone can do covers this sport so in depth.

Also KD is 100000% correct cause if the Warriors win the conversation will isntnatly be about how Curry stacks up all time, TOP 10?, Best PG ever?, Is HE BETTER THEN LEBRON?. The fact KD made the worst choice ever and the Warriors are real winners unlike KD! But if the Warriors lose we probably barely talk about the Celtics cause they're more the nerdy basketball team and instead we will talk about Curry not having FMVPs, only winning one without KD, now being 3-3 in the finals and 1-3 without KD. None of this will be good nor helpful discourse to showcase the sport, but just an excuse for dipshits to get off hot takes about an all time great player/team.",Nets,245,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v3cjna/kevin_durant_on_twitter_my_theory_is_that_guys/,0.9831,0.161,0.753,0.085

He DID rise through the coaching ranks coming up as a video coordinator, and no doubt earned his stripe through his hard work and dedication.

His father is also Jon Spoelestra, former GM of the Blazers and Nuggets, and an executive for the New Jersey Nets (I believe it was in ‚Äò93 he lobbied the NBA to change the [Nets to become the Swamp Dragons.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15155466/once-nets-seriously-considered-becoming-swamp-dragons)) He is widly considered a visionary figure in the sports marketing and promotional game, and had fairly large presence in the NBA because he was around for so long. (He was even an executive for the Buffalo Brave, before they relocated to San Diego and become the Clippers). 

I only point that out to say there isn‚Äôt exactly any infrastructure of ‚Äúcoaching pipeline‚Äù for Asian coaches to realistically become NBA coaches in the near future, especially in an industry line the NBA where it seems the hardest part is breaking into the industry.

But then you read quotes like this, and it's real easy to to be tempted to be that bitch... How you gonna throw shade, when it was highly likely Bucks win the series with Khris, probably in less games too. I mean christ, just Giannis and company took the series to 7 while shooting 57/200 from 3. And yes, same argument can be made for the nets last season. I'm not delusional, but that doesn't mean I can't chime in here

I'm sure it was awesome being able to double Giannis whenever he wanted, knowing that Jrue Holiday was the next best offensive player. I'm sure it was awesome being able to attack George Hill and Grayson Allen on both sides of the ball.

They've been compared to The Shins, but I think The Decemberists has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. 

The Decemberists  released this, The King Is Dead, their most accomplished album.

Derrick fits on a winning team and is just about to turn 28 which makes him a couple years older than Dejounte/Jakob.

It was so hard for some Spurs fans to realize how good he was because a lot of what he does doesn't show up in the box score. 

We got a vet that was very good for us, a random flyer on a young guy, a pick and a pick swap way down the road when the Celtics team is possibly worse.

That‚Äôs one takeaway from my comment. I am also highlighting that citing Spo as some representation of Asian-Americans getting into basketball is also not really the full truth, and not sure if citing Spo as filling in the ‚Äú2%‚Äù quota for Asian representation is fair. 
Despite the lack of a pipeline for Asian coaches, my first link highlights efforts being taken to foster coaching talent, something I felt also contributes to the conversation when talking about representation of Asian-American coaches.  I also felt that the Swamp Dragon story   that  tangentially related to what I was saying was a cool little anecdote that would be appreciated in the forum taking about the NBA.

Edit: also if I don‚Äôt preface that Spo is legit and deserves all his flowers, there will be replies talking about how good Spo is, missing the point I am trying to highlight.

Edit2: after reading my original comment, I actually agree with the above comment, my initial comment was unnecessarily verbose and long winded, and quite frankly had a little too much rambling sprinkled in.

The Warriors set the record for most regular season wins before getting KD. They had worse seasons when they had KD - were they a worse team? Probably not, but they were different. Dynamics change with even just one player. The Grizzlies did pretty damn well against the Warriors this post-season without Ja, are they better without him? Probably not, even if their defense gets better because of his absence. Things change. Teams play up or down sometimes, it happens.

There is absolutely zero point comparing KD getting swept out in the first round when his team and coach are not the Warriors and Kerr. And there's zero point comparing Curry losing game 1 at home when his team and coach are not the Nets and Nash.",NA,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v3qick/steph_curry_won_9_of_his_last_10_nba_finals_games/,0.9509,0.165,0.775,0.061

2022-06-03,Embiids_chick_fil-a,"I actually see half decent discussions when Skip and Shannon are talking about a non LeBron/Laker related team. 

Basically everything excluding the 

- Lakers

- Clippers, because the Clippers are the Lakers‚Äôs rivals

- The  Warriors, as they have faced LeBron several times

- The Nuggets, because they beat the Clippers in 7 2 years ago and the Clippers are rivals to the Lakers

- The Nets, because KD is on a similar level as LeBron

- The Bucks, because Giannis is close in terms of tiers to LeBron 

- The Heat, because they faced LeBron in the finals

- The Celtics because they faced LeBron in the ECF

- The Sixers because Embiid was battling LeBron for MVP for a portion of the season.

- Any tanking/mediocre team in the league, because it just become a discussion on how to trade Russ there

2022-06-03,duplicatesnowflake,"I'll admit it's a pretty surprising statistic but including the KD injury game was a bit much.  Curry and them also won quite a lot of playoff games without KD before the finals including the 3-1 comeback against KD himself and the statement series vs the Rockets in 2019 after getting outplayed by them with KD in 2018 and getting massive injury luck to survive.

But overall it does show just how much tougher it would have been without KD. Which is pretty obvious to anyone remotely familiar with the game. Of course KD put them on easy mode!

There‚Äôs one team who adjusted during the first quarter break: the Celtics. 

Golden State‚Äôs 3-pt opportunities in the first quarter were a result of the inside drive threat. Boston doused that threat in the second which kept the Dubs on the perimeter. Even when you‚Äôre shooting the way GS did in the first, that percentage WILL drop if forced to only play outside. 

If Boston made a few more of those misses in the first, this game wouldn‚Äôt be as close as it is.

2022-06-03,CreatiScope,"Let‚Äôs take the Wolves for example. They have, according to bballref, $137M (M=million) in salary. The salary cap is $112M, the luxury line is $136M. Golden State is at $178M.

Well, Minnesota should be able to spend as much money as the Warriors, right? So, they want to sign Zach Lavine for $30M. Can‚Äôt. They‚Äôre above the limit, can‚Äôt sign new players until they get under. There is still flexibility with certain signings, MLEs and shit like that, but you can‚Äôt add a max contract.

It is possible though, for a player currently on the books to get extended and their new contract is a max. So, in a season, they‚Äôll max Anthony Edwards and they‚Äôll go up to $176 should they keep all their players.

GSW got in an extremely lucky, and were savvy, situation. Because of his injury history, Curry had signed to an extremely small deal, but many years. And because of the timing on Klay and Draymond‚Äôs deals, they found a way to add KD.

The salary cap is based on how much revenue the NBA is projected to make. So, they make a new TV deal, more cash comes in, which means more money for the teams to spend. 2016 was historic because the new TV deal created an enormous spike in the Salary Cap. We saw crazy shit like the Trailblazers giving Evan Turner a huge contract and the Lakers giving Timofey Mozgov an enormous deal.

Combined with the timing of their Big 3‚Äôs lower deals and the cap spike, they were able to sneak  a KD max deal into the works before Klay and Draymond got maxed and Curry got his mega deal (that he deserved).

When KD wanted to walk, GSW convinced him to do a Sign and Trade. So, they inked t deal he wanted with Brooklyn, sent him on his way and received DLO on a comparable max. They moved DLO for Wiggins, also on a similar max deal and now they have 4 guys on max deals.

Without that cap spike, the reality is that they wouldve had to let someone go to maneuver under the cap to get KD signed. But, because of the lowball Curry deal and the unprecedented spike, we got the worst playoffs of the past 30 years in 2017 lol",Celtics,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v3qick/steph_curry_won_9_of_his_last_10_nba_finals_games/,0.6682,0.083,0.857,0.06

I agree with the second part, but there is a lot of evidence that he meddled with what the GM's wanted to do.  Biggest one I can think of is that he fired Kevin Pritchard because the fans and media gave Pritchard all the credit for the great drafting and PA was jealous that he and Bert Kolde didn't get any respect for their contribution to those decisions.  Petty.

I am also convinced that Meyers Leonard got that ridiculous huge, overpaying contract because PA didn't want him to be another Jermaine O'Neil and go somewhere else and become an All-Star.  That move doesn't make sense any other way and Olshey wasn't around when Jermaine left.

PA did spend freely though, because he cared and he wanted to win.  So I give him credit for that.  But he was anything but hands off.",NA,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v3gd9m/wojnarowski_nike_founder_phil_knight_and_dodgers/,0.9798,0.225,0.678,0.097

2022-06-03,laboratory_koala,"Motion/system offenses without ISO can get stagnant vs disciplined defensive squads that don‚Äôt have weak links to attack (can switch a lot and make sure there‚Äôs always a body on the threatening scorers, stay at home against all the role players/floor spacers), like we saw in parts of today‚Äôs game. 

ISO heavy offenses can get stagnant against, you guessed it, disciplined defenses without weak links to exploit (navigate screens etc to ensure your main defenders are matched on ISO threats, and can afford to double because your efficient defensive rotations can recover to the open outlet passes). 

Turns out, having a well coached squad full of versatile and reliable defenders (like the Celtics have) is incredibly potent. In order to beat them, you have to attack on both offensive axes, ball movement and ISO. Or, I guess, defend them even better than they defend you so that you can squeak wins out that way, even if your offense isn‚Äôt humming. 

Nets couldn‚Äôt manage either and so we got swept, despite some close games by the virtue of individual talent on offense.

2022-06-03,MineturtleBOOM,"Well like it does, the executives of many companies are overwhelmingly white male because of a combination of the fact that the majority of the intake for those companies corporate roles was white male and that those people were promoted more. In response many people are pushing for more diversity but no one is claiming executives of these companies should overnight become a directly proportionate representation, since the majority of people with adequate experience simply are white male.

If you look into most attempts to increase representation focus is on increasing diversity of intake (in many countries and industries this has been achieved, I am going into a UK law career so I'll use that as reference, more women then men are starting solicitor careers now and the race representation is getting much much closer to proportional for current trainee intakes) the other focus is increasing retention and promotion of minority employees (again in law women and BME are pretty well represented at trainee and newly qualified level but they are retained far less, mostly at this point due to those employees own choice to leave, showing that something is driving them out of that workplace).

This is the strategy in most industries, no one outside of a niche extreme group wants to immediately impose a direct representation diversity requirement, it's a multi step process that starts with diverse hiring and is completed with proportional retention.

This is a unique case because the playerbase has always been majority black but the coaches weren't, which indicates some kind of bias or other factors stopping the hiring of black players as coaches.",NA,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v3jhdx/transformative_year_black_coaches_now_lead_50_of/,0.5131,0.067,0.877,0.056

He's always been pretty underrated though. Probably in part because JB was so raw out of college (vs the slick NBA-ready JT) and because of JT 's big dunk on lebron his rookie year. JB could easily be the best player on many of the NBA teams.

Thing I love most of about JB apart from all he does from a community aspect though, is his steady improvement year after year. Every off-season he puts in a ton of work and cones in completely revolutionizing a part of his game.

I genuinely don't really understand people blaming Skip for pushing narratives. Are people unable to disagree with talking heads? Lol what is going on? If Skip says that ""rings are literally the only thing that matters and everything else makes you a choking loser who should quit basketball‚Äù, how does that become the ""narrative"" instead of people just going ""that's stupid and I disagree, good thing this guy's words mean literally nothing""

I think the issue is that there are just more people who *actually agree* with Skip on his rings takes, as opposed to the issue being Skip having the take in the first place.

Also, could not disagree more that it's affected players' decisions. I promise you no superstar wants to win a ring because Skip Bayless told them it was important, they want to win a ring because it genuinely *is* the highest achievement you can get in the sport.",Lakers,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v3cjna/kevin_durant_on_twitter_my_theory_is_that_guys/,-0.8674,0.142,0.682,0.176

2022-06-03,Lavaswimmer,"I get what you mean. If your answer to ""are people unable to disagree with talking heads"" is just ""a lot of the time yes"" then I can't really argue with that. I would still, however, put the blame way more on the people unable to critically think about what they're hearing than I would on Skip himself. If that's just his genuine opinion, who am I to say that he can't/shouldn't go on TV to espouse it? More than that, who am I to say that the people who agree with him are wrong to do so and are just not thinking critically, and if only they would think critically then they'd disagree? It's just a sports opinion at the end of the day, I don't think it's that crazy to think that people genuinely think like Skip does.

I still think though that if, for example, some talking heads call Steph better than LeBron if he gets a 4th ring/FMVP (which I think I'm already seeing them do), then they will be widely mocked and laughed at by the NBA world at large - so I dunno. I think people just assume Skip and his ilk have way more influence than they actually do.

2022-06-03,Mylo_WD,"You don't need to have great ""mental abilities"" to be an NBA coach. Being an NBA player requires at least a decent level of understanding of how the game is actually played. How defenses sets and assignments work. How to create offensive schemes to combat that and so on. NBA players go to film sessions on almost a daily basis during the season and study other teams far more on average than any non-NBA person would. Those things are learned and given the fact that players have more exposure to the resources that allows them to learn the game properly, it's only natural that this should give them an advantage.

Obviously quantifying this into an exact number is dumb, but the argument in its base is still reasonable. NBA players should be one of if not the first pool of candidates looked at when deciding to hire for a coaching position. If that's the case, then you should expect to see these positions dominated by black coaches and assistant coaches and it's a valid question to investigate when it's not the case.",NA,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v3jhdx/transformative_year_black_coaches_now_lead_50_of/,-0.0129,0.069,0.882,0.048

Agree with Skip and Shannon. I used to think of Stephen A the same way but now I grudgingly respect him so much more than the other 2. My Stephen A story:

Had lower section seats at the Wizards Celtics 2017 game 6 (the John Wall buzzer beater), and Stephen A was standing in the tunnel below us the entire time. I probably watched him as much as I watched the game. The dude literally knows everybody‚Äîfrom the players and the refs to the suits (agents?) and the security guards to the important-looking courtside fans‚Äîand were dapping up people for the entire game. And he got up the next morning for his show before I had coffee. The guy is probably as connected as Rich Paul and has more energy than Jose Alvarado. Also from the waitress‚Äô reaction, probably a once-in-a-lifetime tipper.

2022-06-03,pytycu1413,">That being said, you can‚Äôt look at guys and Kobe and Lebron, guys who clearly wanted to be the next, better version of MJ, and think the sport was worse off because of him. 


I think Stephen A's point was more directed at the role players rather than the stars than came after MJ and tried to do what he did. 
When you think about it, how are role players perceived today and how were they in 2000s? The money they get should be mostly attributed to the salary cap growth, but back in 2000s, the overwhelming majority impact in the game came from the stars. 
Today, while the stars do carry plenty of the load, the impact the role players and guys coming off bench is bigger. Sometimes, you wonder if D'antoni's suns would have win a chip, how would that impact the game, but is all hypothetical.

Steph, Klay and Warriors changed the game. Today's 3 and D guys are getting more money and more attention than your 2000s role player.
That's my take on what Stephen A meant. That Jordan, because of his greatness focused the attention and money on the star while the role guys were under looked. Because of 3s and today's game, you can be that role guy or coming off the bench and have that impact. Because of it, they get the media attention and the subsequent bag with it.",NA,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v3cjna/kevin_durant_on_twitter_my_theory_is_that_guys/,0.9032,0.059,0.933,0.008

2022-06-03,dr_caligari,"It's late and I know folks just want to get hot takes off, so no worries if you decide not to engage... but while I love Jimmy Butler (he's genuinely one of my all time favorite Bulls and I want nothing but good things for him), I can't get behind the claim he was putting up 40s for fun. Unless he just decided to not have fun in numerous games and also decided his not having fun was more important than his team winning. Because if you check out the [Eastern Conference Finals rundown from the NBA site](https://www.nba.com/playoffs/2022/east-final), you'll notice that while he was the leading scorer, he averaged more than 8 points fewer than Steph's 34.

Look, Boston has one of the best defenses in the league. They're incredibly impressive on that end. It's tough to both put up 34 on them and play winning basketball. I don't know why it's necessary to denigrate somebody's play for putting up 34 against a genuinely great defense. And it makes even less sense to act as though Jimmy did that whenever he wanted with ease. In this instance, I feel like it's not offensive to say that Curry scored well against a strong defense but the Celtics played well enough to win the game capably.",Bulls,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v3q57s/highlight_al_horford_looking_like_lebron_james_in/,0.9981,0.337,0.631,0.032

I do not know what being a former player affects coaching disposition, nor do I want to.

However, 16 out of 30 coaches are former players. Either Black or White, doesn‚Äôt matter.

If ~53% of coaches come from this universe of people, taking the whole population as your basis for analysis is just bad statistics. You have enough data to be more restrictive.

There was always some semi good natured ribbing on flairs. Sometimes it got combative or obnoxious, but it wasn't terrible. And generally it was only if it was related.

Then it turned into a thing to bag on user's flairs regardless of context and used as a way to make it into a semi personal attack.

PTI's been around forever, and even though they're a debate show, I can't think of a time where either one of the hosts said something so outlandish on PTI that they had to apologize for it after a bunch of outrage. On Around the Horn someone says something silly every so often, but then they just get muted.

The problem is that doesn't generate the kind of attention and outrage that the hot take artists they throw big money at generate. That's also probably why these shows get shoved into midday timeslots instead of early morning or prime time.

2022-06-03,BoredomHeights,"Well I'm guessing I'm one of the few Warriors flairs actually on this sub right now, for good reason, but in my experience Warriors fans don't hate KD. He won or helped us win two championships. It's not like the Thunder where we felt he owed us anything. 

I mostly just see KD hate threads with random fans talking about how much Warriors fans hate KD, but very few actual Warriors fans hating KD. It's all second hand. Like ""Oh man, Warriors fans really going in on KD"", but then you scroll down and don't even see any Warriors flairs. 

Some caveats: obviously we still like Steph more and if it's a thread about KD specifically talking shit about the Warriors or something that's different. But that's not the same as KD hate; if he came to the Bay right now we'd all cheer. Also I'm sure some Warriors flairs have said stupid shit about him, but you could pick and choose any hot take and find flairs from any team backing it up.

Kerr is essentially useless. Didn't Walton win more when he stepped in when Kerr had a bad back that season? His rotations are garbage.

Absolutely not, Tatum is a media darling and the whole ""doing it for Kobe"" thing will be a massive part of the media discourse. You're talking about the Celtics as if they're some small market team like the Wizards or something, this is BOSTON we're talking about. 

As for your overarching point, that's just the norm with any massively popular sport because it is ultimately entertainment. The average fan does not care about in-depth analysis and there's nothing wrong with that, even on this sub two of the most upvoted posts are Kellerman farting on air and Paul Pierce talking about the time he shat himself in a game. The vast majority of sports ""analysis"" is always going to be entertainment-focused. I don't really understand what you mean by ""helpful discourse"" because hot takes grow the sport far more than in-depth analysis.

Throughout most of the 2010s KD was seen as the 2nd best player behind Lebron. Steph/Kawhi had a few moments of it but KD even came out with an article of how he was tried of being #2

> Oklahoma City's wunderkind is one of the best players of his generation, but he's not the best. LeBron is. Just like it is LeBron who has won the MVP award three times to Durant's two second-place finishes. LeBron is the one with the ring, a piece of jewelry that came at Durant's expense. And it's LeBron who has cast a shadow over Durant's illustrious career. He's always been one step ahead, one accomplishment further along than his friend. **Will Durant ever be able to free himself from the confines of LeBron's overbearing reputation? We don't know. But he'll try.**

I wish we could simply have real drama.  The stuff like the Bubble, KD joining the team that beat him, Lebron winning in Cleveland, those are real things and prop up the game.  But fake stuff like some guy basing his reputation on hating a player, or talking them down whenever he can despite evidence is stupid and annoying to me.  What I wish is that every pundit is sincere, that nobody exaggerates or lies in order to create fake drama for clicks, and that all of these shows need an actual journalistic component instead of just existing to get people worked up.  I don't think real sports needs fake anger generated, I think that hurts real sports, and it gets us to the point where we don't know what's real anymore.

I think it was actually a scheme thing that made dray less impactful and poole too.

Celtics were hard denying curry, so Kerr wanted Curry to bring up the ball. Dray normaly initates the offense with curry off ball, Poole will also sometimes initiate the offense. 

Curry bringing up the ball helped Curry score, but reduced green and pooles offensive impact.

""Bucks in Six"" has been said for every series since 2013, it's not a special thing for this. It's been a meme for years.

Cs are better this year for sure but they also probably wouldn't have been blown up in 5 against a different team. Bucks were well on their way to getting bounced in 5 themselves, and that's with Harden out and then on one leg, until Kyrie going out. 

That's what makes it so good, I didn't like them much so seeing them fail and then the entire thing get blown up amused me. I'm just not interested in revisionist history and being unrealistic.

2022-06-03,zatchj62,"Nah y'all just ignore all context. Black players make up such a large portion of the NBA because basketball is culturally-engrained in Black American and inner city communities, and thus Black kids are much more likely to pick up the game early in their life. It's why the NBA is a Black-majority league and the NHL is not. With regards to coaches, it follows that the proportion of coaches--many of whom were former players or involved in the game in some way--should naturally follow the demographics of the playing pool.

Now with that said, I think 15 of the 30 NBA coaches being Black is reasonably good representation that falls within the standard error of what we'd expect assuming non-discriminatory hiring practices.

I wouldn't draw a line there. But that's typically around where it ends up being at any given point in time.

Right now, you have Giannis, KD, Embiid, Jokic, Steph, Kawhi, and LeBron basically, plus maybe Jimmy Butler. That's all ""borderline top 5 player"" for sure. And I'm not sure Kawhi even belongs on the list when he hasn't played over 70 games in the last 5 seasons, while LeBron is kind of borderline in that it's hard for him to be that guy as consistently at this point.

So that's 5 guys for sure, plus 3 who for different reasons you can say are borderline top 5 guys.",NA,-1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v3qlc1/smith_ime_udoka_we_look_at_ourselves_as_a_unit_a/,0.8377,0.12,0.834,0.047

Luka is a better overall playmaker, mostly due to his role, but as you saw tonight Tatum has been improving in that area as well.

Grocery work is the only career you've ever had. You aren't trained to do anything else and you don't want to do anything else. You love the work and you're proud to be feeding people.

Now suppose 3/4 of the grocery store managers are black. In fact 3/4 of the grocery store managers around the country are black, so it doesn't matter what store you go to. Not only that, but 3/4 of the district managers who hire store managers are also black, all around the country. And 90% of the store owners are black.

In that scenario, would your presumption be ""I guess black people are just better at running grocery stores than white people,"" or would you wonder if there were larger structural forces causing white people to be denied leadership positions? Would you accept that a co-worker was 3x as likely to attain a leadership role just because of the color of their skin?

2022-06-03,watermelon82,"lol if only it worked like that, basketball isn‚Äôt played on paper

Lots of Celtics fans in here after a win so I understand the downvotes lol. 

But my point is simple - if I ask any team, would you rather your team hit 20+ threes on 50+%, or have your star player score 30 points‚Ä¶ I guarantee everyone picks the first option. 

It‚Äôs a no brainer, teams win a way higher percentage of their games when the first thing happens than when the second does, if anyone wants to make an argument otherwise go ahead but otherwise I‚Äôll just assume there‚Äôs lot of the typical shitty Boston fans in here throwing around downvotes in the wake of their win",Warriors,-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v3q2w0/highlight_al_horford_gets_the_steal_and_hits/,0.8625,0.166,0.753,0.081

2022-06-03,christoph_loren,"Who puts Luka over Butler or Tatum? Lmao less playoff success, worse at literally everything except passing. The only reason he scores more pts is because he has no one else to help him. Tatum without Brown averages 30 ppg in the past two years and is objectively a superior isolation scorer. Oh and Luka is one of the worst defenders in the NBA. Not even close to top 5. And certainly not ahead of Butler or Tatum.

If you're talking strictly offensive impact then yeah Luka is there. But as a total player? Not close.",Celtics,-60,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/v3qlc1/smith_ime_udoka_we_look_at_ourselves_as_a_unit_a/,0.4683,0.141,0.765,0.094
