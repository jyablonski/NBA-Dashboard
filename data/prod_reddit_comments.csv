Lebron makes sure to not burn a bridge in this dispute. he emphasizes that he didn't go ""oh you trippin, I been hitting shots my whole life"" and just says he was hurt by the comments. 

He also goes on to compliment Kyrie a lot in the full podcast, here were some examples of how he praised Kyrie:

- how he plays like a 6'8 guy even at 6'2
- how great of a shotmaker he is, how he finishes around the basket
- posting up Klay who is one of the best 2-way guys ever and shooting over him
- how he wanted Ty Lue to draw the play for Kyrie in 2016 when everybody was missing for 5 minutes straight.
- Kyrie being one of the key reasons he came back to Cleveland because of the talent he saw in him.
- about him being the buffer multiple times when the media went at Kyrie
- describing Kyrie as a great ""signature shoe guy"" to his guys at Nike, and how there's not many of them.

2022-07-03,fuckyeahmageknight,"Michael, please. I have been watching this godforsaken team since the days of Matt Carrol and Primoz Brezec. My cat is named Emeka. I have two Adam Morrison jerseys and a signed promo card from DJ Augustin's rookie debut. The day I turned 13, I asked my parents if I could braid my hair to look like young Jared Dudley. I still believe in Cody Zeller's untapped potential and think that maybe Jeff Taylor could turn it around one of these days. I spent six months on Duolingo premium learning French just to shout insults at Boris Diaw after he gave up on the team, and I would do it again. The greatest moment of my life was sitting in the front row when Byron Mullens baptized Lamarcus Aldridge. The Bobcats Playoff Anthem remix is still my go to hype song in the gym. I'm probably the only basketball fan in America who even knows who Cory Higgins is. There are nights I can't sleep, where all I can see are visions of Big Al tearing his plantar fascia minutes into the playoffs. I just want to see some semblance of a long term plan, Michael. Your playing career lasted 15 seasons and you won 119 playoff games. Do you know how many Charlotte has won in the last 15 years? 3. Not 3 series, 3 games.

2022-07-03,TheDudeWhoDidDaThing,"He said AEW focuses on wrestling to the detriment of storylines compared to WWE, which is as comical as the topic of this thread. People can disagree with AEW being the better product all they want, **it's subjective**, but to say AEW doesn't focus on storylines is nothing short of absurd. They make it a point to tell long, medium and short term stories consistently. As someone who's a fan of AEW and not WWE (I don't dislike WWE, I just haven't been their target audience in many years), I would argue they are worlds better at the wrestling side of it **and** the wrestling storytelling side of it.

Find me a WWE storyline (other than Reigns vs Brock V19.0) to stretch multiple calendar years like the Hangman story did, or the Wardlow story did, or The Elite break-up/reform story is doing.

I'm a Bill Simmons fan, I'll keep listening but it just illustrated that unless you're really in tune with a product, you probably shouldn't be making such broad sweeping statements as ""they don't tell stories"".

Edit - I didn't actually see the SC hate on this topic, I just assume this is what it was because my eyes rolled back into my skull when he and Heelwani were saying this stuff.

2022-07-03,PatrickBaldwinJr,"Tim Duncan was one of the most surefire prospects ever.  He'd have gone #1 after his Sophomore year or Junior year, let alone his Senior year.

He got picked by a team with some of the lowest ratings in the NBA.  (From 2000-2019 the 4 lowest rated finals involved the Spurs.)

Oden/Durant were both supposed to be generational talents and those picks went to teams in the PNW.

After Lebron left the Cavs had basically 0 ratings, but they got 3 #1 picks.  Unless you think the NBA/Lebron planned 3 years ahead for Lebron to rejoin the Cavs this was just awful for NBA ratings.

I know you're probably trolling with your all caps post, but anyone who thinks the NBA draft was rigged because of convenient drafts and just ignores 

Also the #1 pick the Oden/Durant year was a 5% chance for Portland.  Like yeah, let's give a team that doesn't generate ratings a 1/20 chance for a generational players.

Ewing was sus... but in the grand scheme of things the top couple of picks do not favor NBA ratings.",TrailBlazers,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vq7ucm/ryan_blackburn_the_lakers_traded_all_of_their/,0.5788,0.116,0.793,0.091

2022-07-03,NextMention20,"I get Washington has no other choice, but this is the huge problem with the super max in the NBA. Washington is spending $50.2 million a year for a player that isn‚Äôt even a super star, and they are punished for it, by the whole super max counting against the cap. Tbh, make the super max work to where only the max contract counts against the cap for the qualifying team, and the excess super max money over the max contract, doesn‚Äôt count against the cap for the team offering the super max. Make the whole super max contract count against their cap space though, for teams that try to trade for said super max player. 

This makes it more fair, especially for smaller market teams, and allows for more roster flexibility.

Would anybody *really* be surprised if Kyrie decided at the start of the season he wouldn‚Äôt play another game until people stopped eating meet or renounced sports to live in the Tibetan wilderness or something?

People forget Kyrie problems didn‚Äôt start with the vaccine stuff. The man has never confirmed that he understands the world is round and he was already disappearing for stretches of games before COVID. I think there was one time literally no one knew where Kyrie was for like a week and then he turned up on someone‚Äôs Instagram at a wedding in Canada.

2022-07-03,rebeltrillionaire,"I get that, but LeBron might just be a good person who's pretty stoic. Like, if you just drop the ego aspect like he did. The quote is pretty hurtful considering LeBron did the correct team leader shit and also his ""I want Ky to get MVP"" is very reflective of his playstyle and what he's said throughout his career. 

He likes to make other players better. 

He said the same shit about AD in L.A. That he wants him to get all the awards, all the accolades, lead the team and take over. 

Like it's kinda crazy to me that people still think this is a show. Shaq was a bully. He was fun, and it was great to be on his side, but you can tel he's got bully tendencies. When he gives speeches on leadership and how you're supposed to act. You know you can't take him 100%. Because we know who he really is. 

Similarly, when Kobe and Jordan talk about leadership or how they support people. It's all about saying, ""I am the example. Just follow this. If you want to be better, this is how I prepare, beat that."" Notorious assholes. Lack of empathy. Lack of compassion. 

LeBron's ""PR trained"" approach to leadership and controversy is basically him doing the right thing, the thing that you wish you would have done in retrospect, without your ego without your emotions dictating your behavior. And he's done it for almost 20 years. 

And when he ""slips up"" and the facade cracks it isn't revealing some hideous personality that's been lurking beneath the surface. It's just revealing a normal flawed human being. 

It honestly feels like so many people who watch LeBron are just waiting until he like murders a family or something.",Lakers,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vqapkx/lebron_after_the_2020_title_responding_to_kyries/,0.967,0.191,0.676,0.133

But Curry got the ball, dribbled up at a relatively slow pace, and takes a 3 from near half court to win the game. At the time, that was unheard of. He still had 3 seconds on the clock to get closer to the rim but he didn't care. Any player who takes a shot like that in any other era would have been criticized heavily, and chewed out by the coach. The confidence that Curry had to take a shot like that when there was still time on the clock, was insane. It seems relatively normal now, but I truly believe it all started with that shot.

2022-07-03,JMEEKER86,"> feel like dudes that aren‚Äôt top 5-8 getting the super max crazy hurts teams

Yeah, if you look at the supermax criteria I think you can see where the problem is.  
    
MVP - worth  
DPOY - debatable  
any All-NBA team - 15 players make All-NBA each year and there are absolutely not 15+ guys worthy of the supermax  
    
Honestly, I would make it so that the supermax is just for MVP or All-NBA first team. Here's who has been All-NBA first team over the last 5 years (length of a supermax).  
    
Jokic  
Giannis  
Tatum  
Doncic  
Booker  
Kawhi  
Curry  
AD  
LeBron  
Harden  
PG13  
Dame  
    
That list makes sense to me for supermax guys with the exception of Dame. Everyone else is either very clearly worth one now or was at the time but has had issues with injuries or getting old. But now let's look at who has made All-NBA third team, guys who are *also* supermax eligible currently.  
    
KAT  
LeBron  
Siakam  
CP3  
Trae  
Gobert  
Butler  
PG13  
Beal  
Kyrie  
Tatum  
Simmons  
Russ  
Blake  
Kemba  
Curry  
Oladipo  
    
That is a way *way* worse list with some guys who absolutely have no business making a supermax. The first list is guys that you could definitely win a championship or at least get to the finals with them as your best player (and indeed most of them already have). The second list...most of them aren't getting you out of the first round if they're your best player. The difference is massive.",NBA,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vpvizz/wojnarowski_cleveland_cavaliers_allstar_guard/,0.9739,0.141,0.805,0.054

2022-07-03,severus_snapshot," I'll be honest and say I thought it'd be Suns in 4. Mavs had not beaten them in years. I accepted that DAL was just cursed against them and that PHX was just the better, more balancecd team. PHX had the best record in the league with 64 wins. 12 more than Dallas. PHX wins convincingly, by 20, and goes up 2-0. Luka gets absolutely embarrassed on D. It looked BLEAK to put it lightly.

  
Then somehow Dallas wins 4 out of the next 5. With margins of 9, 10, 27, and 33. Is this one of the greatest upsets in league history given not just that they won but HOW they won? There was maybe 1 analyst that even picked the Mavs.  


I guess the magic was making CP3 defend the PnR until his body collapsed.

2022-07-03,MJsHoopEarring,This is what I'm saying. KD is and has been acting in bad faith and the players know it. I think we might see a push for a provision in the next CBA barring trades for X amount of time on max deals and they will know exactly why. There is a reason you don't see this kind of thing in SA or MIA. Do players request trades from these organizations? Sure. But it's never this messy with them because the players know that they shouldn't do a great organization dirty like that. The Nets gave Kyrie and KD everything they wanted and they are still screwing the team over. I would trade Kyrie and make KD play out the rest of his deal.

1. KAT apparently does better on the perimeter than dropping back of defense.

3. You don't need to give Gobert a ton of looks offensively, so you can let your more efficient scorers like KAT and Edwards go to work.
4.  Gobert should improve the Minnesota defense and if he gets sucked out to the perimeter, it won't be like in Utah because ANT and KAT can block people in the paint which wasn't happening in Utah.

2022-07-03,Sonofek,"I only started following basketball a few years ago, in the season before Haywoo's last with Utah. The season before he left, I didn't really have any particular player I considered my favorite, but the Jazz became my team because they were a likeable bunch of misfits that always seemed to compete.

We got Donovan Mitchell and I immediately gravitated towards him, with his original draft interview and watching him play at Summer League. I took him to win RotY before the season started at 14/1, and I'm still bitter about it. Donovan Mitchell was my favorite player. Actually that's a lie, he was my favorite potential superstar. I really loved Derrick Favors, he was my favorite after his heroics in Game 6(?) against the clippers when Rudy was targeted by the refs.

The next few years were incredible, Joe, Rubio, Crowder. Those teams were some of the best, even if the Rockets ruined our hopes and dreams. Mitchell was still the up and coming soul of the team and had so much untapped potential. He would have these crazy passes from time to time, and you could just salivate thinking the PG he could become after Rubio was gone. 

Rubio was gone, and the Conley trade happened. The team was good, though losing Rubio was definitely a blow to the heart. Lot of the changes to the team were. Trading Favors was so grievous that we bought him back, only to trade him again. It was around this time that I started really watching Rudy. How much he did for this team. Only for everyone that clearly didn't watch him play to shit on him constantly.

This past season, Rudy was without a doubt my favorite player. I was on the fence for awhile, and I was really hoping that if the front office had to trade one of their stars, and only one, that it would be Mitchell.

2022-07-03,To_me_my_board,"Everybody since Jordan is a case study of how ring culture works. 

The only reason that Pau Gasol gets any respect now is because he won two titles with Kobe. 

But that dude was playing basketball at a level nearly as high as Duncan for several years. 

AD was playing like an MVP on a shit team, and everybody was like ""But he can win"" as if he had Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Danny Ainge, Dennis Johnson, and Bill Walton rounding out his roster. 

LeBron not as good as Jordan because he's not 6-0 in the finals, ignoring the fact that he did more with less (Jordan was literally 1-9 in his first three playoff series). And that's not to say that LeBron is better than Jordan, merely that the arguments made in favour of Jordan were often cherry picking stats. 

Winning is the greatest metric.

So it's fair to a degree to measure players based on their team success. 

However, it's not simply ""Did they get a ring"""" Rather, it should be ""Did they make their teams better?""  

Kyrie has a ring. 

CP3 does not. 

But EVERYWHERE Chris Paul has gone, the teams have gotten drastically better. 

Everywhere Kyrie goes, they do better or as well when he leaves. 

As a rookie, Chris Paul helped the Hornet secure a 20-win improvement. 

Kyrie only got two more wins out of the Cavs, and that was with ANOTHER lottery pick joining the team the same year. 

But rings? Those are based a LOT on context and opportunity. 

Kobe. Magic. Duncan. Bird. Those cats started their rookie seasons in AMAZING situations.

You put Jordan or LeBron in a similar situation, and they both are likely chasing 10 rings. I mean... just imagine LeBron or Jordan with the rosters around them that Magic and Bird had, and the front offices picking guys like Reggie Lewis, AC Green, and Byron Scott late in the first or second round, and then bringing in top draft picks like Len Bias and James Worthy.",NA,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vpuvy3/dame_and_kd_are_two_case_studies_of_how_ring/,0.9976,0.229,0.73,0.041

It was absolutely in poor taste, but it was still very early on in the pandemic, definitely before half of America started taking it seriously (since him shutting down the NBA and Tom Hanks getting it on the same day was kinda the catalyst.)

The writer basically said the Jazz media room had started taking safety precautions. Previously all the media would be fairly close to the tables where the interviews were being held, but they were pushed quite a distance back, I believe with some safety plastic up. I could be wrong on that point, since it's obviously been a few years. 

But I remember him mentioned they were kinda joking about it, and when ending his interview Rudy did the whole mic touch. Again, it was in poor taste, but the writer thought it might have been in solidarity with the writers who were pushed so far back.

2022-07-03,Igoritzy,"Im gonna go around the actual explanation and provide you with more understandable answer 

There is currently active Bitcoins valued at 1.03 trillion USD, in the world. That's 1000 billion, for example, State of Norway (which owns oil business, and is one of the wealthiest nations in the world) has total GDP of 362 billion USD (Peaked to 530 billion pre-covid). 

Before 2009, there was ZERO Bitcoin value in the world. 

There is 1.03 billion USD injected into world's economy without trade in a period of 10 years. 

Economy MUST compensate for such huge amount of money. 

For example - dude bought 100 bitcoins in 2012 for 1300 USD. Today, he has the same 100 btc, but valued at almost 2 million dollars. He goes and buys a house, a car, and tons of shit. REAL stuff was given to him in exchange for bitcoin 

Guy that had virtually nothing in 2012, is now using that virtual asset to buy real stuff, and people selling that stuff must be compensated in yet another real asset, in order to balance out the economic principle

In order to compensate, economy must make balance some other way. And this time, it cant cut corners (micro inflation, stock manipulaton, etc) because total sum of virtual money is a fuckin 1.03 trillion USD, you need to cut something huge in order to compensate 

How exactly will that happen for a freakin trillion, beats me. We live in a silly world where due to stock value of Orange or Gold going down, 200 companies around the world cease to exist, and if by any chance some volcano stops airplanes for 2 weeks, your bread and milk are suddenly more expensive than 2 weeks ago.",NA,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vq8t72/the_official_cryptocurrency_brokerage_of_the/,0.968,0.112,0.866,0.022

2022-07-03,areese4960,So I just wanted to say this about the whole KD and nets situation. Unless the nets get an offer for KD that they just can‚Äôt miss out on why would they trade him. The job of the GM is to do what is best for the team not trade any player who request to be moved. He‚Äôs got 4 years left and he is 34 years old. Like what is he gonna do if they don‚Äôt trade him sit out for 4 seasons and then leave at 38 years old to try and chase and ring lol yeah I doubt he would pull that move. The Nets really have all the leverage in my opinion like if they say ‚ÄúNo KD we aren‚Äôt trading you‚Äù KD wouldn‚Äôt sit out or half ass it out there in my opinion he wouldn‚Äôt want that ding on his legacy which let‚Äôs face it from all the history we have of KDs career he wouldn‚Äôt be able to just sit out he would definitely go out there and play. The Nets could try to get some pieces to surround him for Kyrie and they still have Ben Simmons. This is all coming from a Knicks fan but still I really don‚Äôt think they Nets should trade him at all call him on his bluff if he really won‚Äôt play then at least you tried there‚Äôs no trade I bet out there that‚Äôs gonna get you a KD caliber player in the next 4 years they went for KD and now they gotta deal with it.,NA,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vm1d7q/202223_nba_free_agents_and_team_roster_tracker/,0.7814,0.072,0.894,0.035

Lebron averaged 30 per game last season but Westbrooks inability to be effective with Lebron off the court often lost leads for the lakers. People state Westbrook is more available than Kyrie, who the fuck cares if while he‚Äôs on the court he‚Äôs missing layups and turning it over.

This season we made Looney look like Shaq. Last season Zubac was treating KP and Powell like children in the glass (this considering that Luka was cooking him whenever he was drawn to the perimeter). From the C deals made, I have zero issue with McGee making 7M, specially since Noel is making 10M and I would be happy if the Knicks made a S&T with him for us instead of Detroit.

My take is that he‚Äôs probably going to resign just based off the success of the team this year and y‚Äôall have his bird rights, so it comes down to if the owner is willing to go over the luxury tax for him. The other side of the argument is that he is older (not necessarily fitting the younger timeline, but since they‚Äôre contending, that‚Äôs not too relevant) and I can see other teams paying him way more than what Memphis is comfortable doing so considering he can fit very well into basically any teams bench units and a good chunk of teams starting lineups

Firstly, his job is doing media. He does an excellent job of it, based on all the numbers the show does.

He is not a GM, he does not have a job description that is more than talk about basketball in an entertaining way.

It's not about holding media guys to the same standard as fans, it's just understanding that it's not a big deal - in a conversational podcast - if someone gets the details of the CBA wrong, and that the show isn't contingent on perfect understanding of a CBA rule that shows up once every decade that effectively no-one knew about anyway.",Bucks,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vpwrsm/trae_young_reacts_to_bill_simmons_apologizing_for/,0.0523,0.086,0.835,0.08

everyone seems to think nets would buy russ out, but i think they'll either keep for the expiring, or more likely flip him at the trade deadline for one or two more picks.

i think by the trade deadline in feb, a lot more teams will value that massive expiring to sign a max player the next year. it's just right now, the lakers can't afford to wait til the trade deadline

We acquire KD for Scottie and no other major roster players, he happily plays four seasons in Toronto at a top 10 level with minimal injury issues or age related decline. 

We keep Scottie and he naturally develops into an All-Star or All-NBA talent that plays in Toronto for a decade. 

Even if scenario one goes perfectly, our window will slam shut and we will suck after KD retires/leaves. In scenario two, we have a budding star who loves Toronto and is dedicated to improving.

People thought Curry could definitely be a star but no one thought he'd be a generational talent like he is now. Zion on the other hand is one of the most hyped prospects of modern times and has shown that the hype may very well be legit. Both players are gambles because of injuries, but Zion's possible upside is so much higher than what people thought Curry's was. When Curry emerged as a superstar it was a bit of a surprise, even the Warriors didn't think he'd be *that* good, while if Zion reaches a similar level it'll more so be considered meeting expectations

Edit: A much better comparison would be Embiid actually. He'd missed 2 entire seasons and played only 31 games‚Äîless than half of what Zion has played at this point‚Äîwhen he was offered his rookie max extension so it's not even like Zion getting it now is unprecedented",Pistons,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vq0uev/wojnarowski_new_orleans_pelicans_star_zion/,0.9871,0.209,0.762,0.029

When Lebron won with the Lakers I was like fuck it lets take this show on the road. 

So I acquired Lebron and kept the franchise star and either added Steph or Giannis 

(Trust me pair Lebron with either of those two and its instant Finals appearance...the local team star rarely was needed) 

You only need 1 guess for what franchise was this it the hardest to win the ring for...

Hint:

You would think that rhyming with Rings would make it easy to win but nope, took me 3 tries.

A team of  Lebron, Giannis, Fox and Harrison was barely enough to get out the West and beat a fully formed Warriors squad.

I dont enjoy it more than the on the court action do, while some people live for the off-court stuff. Thats fine and all, but if thats secondary to you it might seem weird when people go extra wild about it. (Really not tryna be a gatekeeper tho, if nba drama is your favorite part of the league thats fine too, just get more excited bout different things)

The point where it loses me is when everything is rumors and speculation where no one knows whats true and whats random bullshit. I like the drama when things are actually happening, like KDs trade request, but the ""heres a random year long scenario based on a trade that hasnt happened and a lot of assumptions about the regular season, how would this effect [player]'s legacy?"" Is just a waste of time to me imo. Reporters throw out way too much shit during peak hype though. Until a move happens you never know whats real, whats leaking to make 1 side look good but is bs, or what a reporter has made up to get their name out there/get the clicks of the day but has no evidence to back it up cus everything is up in the air and rumors be flying left and right.

2022-07-03,bullymeahhh,"The Nets do not have much leverage here and I never said they did. The problem for the Lakers is that they are under much more pressure to win now than the Nets. The Lakers only leverage right now is if the unlikely scenario of them starting the season off well plays out and they can just wait to acquire Kyrie at the deadline when the Nets will be force to trade him. The more likely scenario is that they start the season off poorly, and then they're forced to make a move, unless they just decide to play with fire by betting on the fact that they'll be able to make up enough ground to get to the top 6 seeds after not acquiring Kyrie until right before the trade deadline. There's also the risk that the Lakers waiting ends with another team being interested in trading for Kyrie and Kyrie deciding he's okay playing there. For those reasons, I think the Nets' leverage outweighs the Lakers'.


Another thing, you are insane if you think they're losing KD for mostly picks. They will be getting a star/up and coming star, and possibly other players,  in addition to a bunch of picks. Mostly picks is what Rudy Gobert was just traded for.

2022-07-03,4trackboy,"Personally this doesn't change anything for me because the way I perceive his personality I've already come to terms with KD just being a good dude. Except for his current situation he's never requested a trade mid-contract and from what we can see of him he also just seems like a sensible guy who's thinking about stuff frequently and sometimes probably a bit too much. One thing this sub doesn't understand is that making a mistake or a bad statement doesn't reflect on a person's personality or moral code and as KD is empathetic and wants to do the right thing he's also changed his stance on many topics quite a few times. 

But instead of acknowledging that KD is just trying to do right and that he also hasn't always been happy with his decisions this sub takes it as another nail in the coffin for not sticking to something he deemed true 4 years ago if you know what I mean. Which is funny because r/NBA changes its stance on players based on single games and sometimes single moments all the time.

If you're viewing KD through a neutral lens and just be observant about his social media and general behaviour it's very easy to see that he tries to please people and be the best player on the court he could possibly be. And that's where he takes his pride from, doing even the lamest workout routines at 200% intensity which is so spectacular to people in the same boat as him they call it inspirational and one NBA player even cried after seeing KD's dedication to Basketball first-hand. So, as boring as 17-18 was I just respect the fuck out of his dedication and I also view him as one of the more truthful and honest personalities in NBA media. Sometimes his bluntness just offers fodder for haters that can't live down the KD Warriors era because other than that he's done nothing wrong.",NA,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vq2j7x/nba_rumors_kevin_durant_is_at_least_open_to/,0.9762,0.137,0.79,0.073

THOR is down from over $400 to less than a dollar with not a singular positive month in the past year. KlimaDAO is down from over $3500 to $2.91. BTC by the pandemic start date is up 110%~ which is great don‚Äôt get me wrong.

2022-07-03,rebeltrillionaire,"I really don't know. If the goal is to ADD salary, you need salary to start (see: Andrew Wiggins and how he ended up getting added to their core). 

LeBron/Kyrie can be re-signed using Bird rights. If we want to break $200M in salaries, we have to use Joe Harris' deal. 

You trade Harris for anyone within 125%, which would mean: $24.9M and less (and likely expiring as well). 

I don't know if we'd get anyone really interesting and you can't break it up, like trade Harris for two sign-and-trades at $12M each. 

You also can't add someone else to the deal to jump it to the next level. 

We also get hardcapped. 

I think basically it comes down to the Laker wanna go all in on 1 season with this core of LeBron / AD / Kyrie. And Seth provides shooting AND some defense. He actually defends \*Steph\* Curry pretty decently. Which is actually important next season if you're going for it. 

It's nice that Curry is expiring, but I don't think that's it. 

If it's really \*just\* about saving money. We could also add Nunn + THT for Joe Harris. 

That saves around another $4M bringing the total saved to about $6M or $7M. 

Also Nunn and THT will be easier to trade into cap space for picks. So the Nets could just drop $15M off their roster pretty easily.",Lakers,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vq4eor/haynes_draft_compensation_is_an_ongoing_talking/,0.9623,0.109,0.88,0.011

I‚Äôll admit something to you I have hardly ever said publicly:

1. Steve Nash was my second favorite player, closely trailing Kobe and higher than D Rose. 

2. I loved the Suns so much in 2010 that the entire roster became my heroes. I thought that they over performed and I was low key rooting for them over my Lakers even during that 6 game showdown. I even let out a disappointed ‚Äúoh no‚Äù while all my friends exploded in joy at that Artest put back. 

3. Those Gentry teams with Marcin Gortat Lou Amundson JRich Nash Hill Dragic Frye Dudley‚Ä¶.they were the definition to me of an underdog overachiever and they won my heart

4. I have jacked off to so much ASU porn you won‚Äôt believe it

5. Kyler Murray is my favorite QB. Not in his achievement but in his play style‚ÄîI often call him the Curry of the NFL. 

6. Your team did choke ballsaqz, but during the Bubble, y‚Äôall once more became my fave team to root for

7. I used to be the only one of my honors who argues vehemently for Booker right outta college after my homies slammed him as being a jj redick

8. One of the most beautiful women I have ever had the pleasure of meeting and‚Ä¶you know‚Ä¶.was at Sedona. 

9. I don‚Äôt agree at all with the Mf‚Äôer at all, but I recognize and respect John McCain and watched his funeral in entirety

10. My best friend was born in Phoenix

There wasn't a trade available. It was either Draft Ivey/Murray or draft one of the other prospects. The other teams 6-8 probably liked their guys too. So then you are looking at trading the 4th pick for the 10th and 12th pick to get what is likely an asset that you also have to spend money on and might not fit with the team.

Also, Ivey might be a great prospect, but how many teams need a player like Ivey? Then also Murray is a shooting SF/PF type player that also plays defense. Almost all teams need that.

Embiid had the same exact concerns as Zion and he got the max. How'd that work out for the Sixers?

Now, say what you will about Gobert, but they did find a way to make this team better defensively, and better on rebounding, while giving Edwards, McDaniels and Nowell more touches. Namely, they traded away a full lineup of players for a putback dunker and rim protector.

I mean, there's a huge difference between a team massively underperforming because of injuries/a terrible trade and just assuming a team that won a title on their own with the same exact core in the last 7 years would miss the playoffs entirely, especially considering Steph carried the Warriors to the play-in without Klay and they were getting Klay back.

Predicting the Lakers miss the playoffs would be because of injury, which is what happened. But if you thought they'd be a top 3 seed you're crazy. (they had no bench and Westbrook was an obviously bad fit) Simmons didn't predict any injuries, he predicted a Finals-winning core with the best shooter in history would miss the playoffs entirely a year after he carried his team to the playoffs, and he was getting his ultimate wingman back.

Nets trade Simmons to San Antonio for Poeltl, Richardson and McDermott. Nets get off Simmons contract and get expiring contracts of players that actually play, but more importantly they get Simmons off their roster opening up room for all the other designated rookie extensions they might want for a KD trade. 

As has been said, KD is the most valuable trade asset in nba history. Doing this trade with SA will maximize that return even if it short sells what they'll be able to get for Simmons if he returns and is at his best (which obviously is no guarantee).

2022-07-03,The_Void_Reaver,"Kind of an aside but I can‚Äôt begin to explain how happy I am that Bledsoe‚Äôs rep got ripped apart these last few years. He had one alright season with the Suns then acted like he was hot shit and got away with tanking his trade value to basically nothing. Then he got traded to quite literally the best situation imaginable and was supposed to be MKE‚Äôs last piece to the title puzzle. Only problem is he can‚Äôt play at that level and cried to get out the second he saw adversity. 

People cry foul about player movement but Bledsoe forcing his way out was one of the most egregious examples that no one talks about. It‚Äôs the equivalent of I‚Äôd Dejounte Murray just sent out a tweet explicitly stating ‚ÄúI will not play for the spurs next season.

2022-07-03,wolftrouser,"A ring is a ring btw, KD has proved himself over and over again, lead scorer, finals mvps etc...  he is not clowned, that is what the stupid media like Chuck and the whole bus rider thing suggests... 

Dame is almost as good a player as steph, but he is indeed very unlikely to win anything at portland because of bad team composition, but honnestly, he does not care, neither does the majority of players, when faced with the choice of earning 30-40million/year or reduce your salary and win titles I can say for myself that the generational wealth of staying in a team with little chances but earning big time is worth more than having more rings and less money. 

In the end we gotta remember theese guys are bringing along their whole family, sometimes a whole neighborhood with their carreer as professional players, they are likely to prioritize money over titles, just like we do we our carreers in the ""normal world"".

His loyalty is with the Celtics, but he's obviously a giant basketball nerd. I do not listen to him for deep analysis, it's a heightened version of the sports conversations that happen at bars. Sometimes your buddy hates your team or has a bad take, but you keep him around bc ultimately it's just sports and who gives af. 

Which is why I won't argue with anyone who doesn't like Bill for you know aesthetic reasons. Finding his demeanor annoying or his voice or the way he interacts with guests etc. etc. Or even that *his* bad takes are particularly grating.

All I meant by mentioning the Knicks is that being a big market team with a famous history isn‚Äôt enough, there are other factors involved other than being in LA and being the Lakers, because if they only had that and nothing else, they would have ended up like the Knicks long ago.

2022-07-03,MidnightMerc,"Cardinals and Suns both collapsed in the playoffs after a great start in the season. So that really fucking hurt. Rams & Warriors just won their championships. Diamondbacks are mid at best this season and they are 4th at best to the Dodgers, Giants, and Padres in the NL West. Cali teams seem to be winning titles while the Suns finally went from basement dwellers to Playoff contenders to the laughing stock of the fucking league. At least y'all won a title with LeBron a couple years ago.

It do kinda suck here in AZ. Right now there's random rainfall and humidity in 90 to 100 degree F temperature and it's not even supposed to be monsoon season yet.

Oh and do I remind you that Sarver and McD were the FO that drafted Ayton. I love Monty and what he's done to foster a better culture for the Suns, but he straight up quit on Ayton. Sarver hired Kokoslov, Luka's euroleague/Slovenia's head coach, as head coach before Monty, but decided to draft Ayton due to his U of A background. Sure Sarver and co, might be right about Ayton, but that dumbass was the one who wanted him in the first place. Enough to draft him first overall.

But when you make things for content you open yourself up to get clowned when you look silly, which is exactly what's happening. Playin counts as playoffs, even if I hate that it does.

Not expecting the Warriors to be good or a high seed was perfectly reasonable. Not expecting them to even make the playoffs (including play-in) without suggesting a major injury is asinine.

Part of the reason podcasters who make these takes stay in business is because people clown them for their bad takes. Bad publicity is still publicity.

Unless he retires, the Lakers are in a way more dire situation. The Nets could potentially recoup some of what they lost with this KD trade and they also don't have to trade either of them immediately if they don't want to. 

The Lakers on the other hand have leveraged their future already, aren't trading LeBron unless he wants it and won't trade AD unless he wants it (in which case, you're getting back a player or players and not necessarily a lot of draft assets).

1. Bron would not commit past those basically 1 year deals with the Cavs. You‚Äôre asking Kyrie to keep his wagon hitched to a team that could essentially blow up at any time. I don‚Äôt think he wanted to be stuck there with years left on his deal if Bron suddenly decided to leave. Yeah you can ‚Äútrust‚Äù that he‚Äôd be there as long as you were, but that honestly isn‚Äôt the proper way to manage your own career. If it wasn‚Äôt Kyrie, I think more people would acknowledge that.

2. Let‚Äôs be real, they were absolutely dangling him for Paul George. Again, Kyrie was to put his future in his own hands in case shit went south. Regardless of how it ended, Boston was a better landing spot than wherever he would have gotten traded to if the Cavs wanted to switch things up.

3. They were not beating the KD Warriors. Let‚Äôs be real here. The Cavs had maxed out the utility of the Bron-Kyrie-Love team. Getting to the finals and losing to the Warriors was best case scenario for the Cavs, so I don‚Äôt blame Kyrie for thinking it was time to go.

2022-07-03,blagaa,"AD, Harden (Hou) got dealt within the last 4 years.  Hard to say what the rate of stars forcing trades will be going forward but it may be higher than expected, and there'll be stars who come available a year or two before hitting FA.  There always are.

KD is an all-time talent but what matters is what production you think he provides over the next 4 years.  He generally gets a pass for Brooklyn not working out because of Kyrie but KD is complicit as an enabler.

I can see Masai being enticed, the team has been searching for a way to transform into a contender again post-Kawhi and capitalize on FVV/Siakam's primes and this could be it.  But if KD isn't considered to be serious about the opportunity and willing to check his large ego at the door, then you've got to pass and wait for another opportunity.

Realistically, the only trade with time pressure is Phoenix as Ayton can get sick of waiting, sign an offer sheet and blow their chances.  Now he might also be hoping for a S&T at a high salary to Brooklyn.

If the Nets prefer any other deal, they'll just wait and pit teams against each other.

I can't even pinpoint what teams definitely want in on Phoenix - most teams with young players like Memphis/NO probably want to see their young cores play out over the next few seasons vs. acquiring a 34 yo with championship expectations with a hangover due to the potentially massive pick equity going back.",Raptors,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vq2j7x/nba_rumors_kevin_durant_is_at_least_open_to/,0.91,0.14,0.814,0.046

2022-07-03,__IZZZ,"I was looking at revenue per club for premier league clubs, 2020, Everton placed 6th. I didn't bother to search for more recent data since it's pretty much a given Manchester United are going to be at the top by a wide margin compared to the majority of the smaller clubs.  

According to Statistica, 2021 data, here are the top 5 clubs (Everton came 15th in this list which includes all clubs, interestingly) ranked by revenue. I have also included the 20th result in order to demonstrate the concentration of revenue.   

1. Barcelona - 792 (millions of dollars)  
2. Real Madrid - 792  
3. Bayern Munich - 703  
4. Manchester United - 643  
5. Liverpool - 619  
(20). AS Roma - 156  

Here are the same results for the NBA, again 2021.  

1. LAL - 316 (millions of dollars)      
2. NYK - 298  
3. Utah - 262  
4. GSW - 258  
5. 76ers - 236  
(20). Indiana - 179  

Sources:  https://www.statista.com/statistics/1231497/revenue-of-football-clubs-in-2021/  

https://www.statista.com/statistics/193704/revenue-of-national-basketball-association-teams-in-2010/  

(I have no idea why the url says 2010, the data is 2021. Other sources give slightly different figures, e.g. Forbes has the Knicks at #1 with $298 million but ultimately it tells the same story).  

I am aware that the NBA has some sort of revenue sharing scheme to help teams in smaller markets, and that would not be taken into account in a true 'free market', and that covid has had an impact on all these figures.  

Regardless Football revenues are significantly higher, and highly concentrated at the top end among a few elite clubs - only 3 teams from the Spanish league appear in the top 20, and only 1 French team, which is significant considering how high they are (PSG - 599) and how low the 20th result is.  

Looking at only the Premier League, which has a more balanced concentration of revenue compared to other European leagues, the NBA has 30 teams in contrast to 20 in the PL, meaning a higher revenue per team despite NBA having a higher revenue overall according to this wiki page:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_professional_sports_leagues_by_revenue

This does NOT include Champions League revenue, which when added makes PL teams blow NBA teams away.  

Also of note from this page is the French Ligue 1 - they have a revenue per team of 85 million euros (again excluding CL), which when considering that PSG in the same league had a revenue of  574 million euros, shows has ridiculously unbalanced the revenue is for teams in this league, and how wrong you are.",NA,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vq0uev/wojnarowski_new_orleans_pelicans_star_zion/,0.9121,0.076,0.887,0.036

2022-07-03,Rhongomiant,">I hope your sub and fans are prepared to run back a team with disgruntled players.

This isn't as bad as you make it sound. There was a time when Kobe wanted out of LA, too. This situation absolutely can be salvaged. Kyrie, KD, and Simmons never even stepped foot on the court together. It wouldn't hurt to see how that actually plays out.

If KD is traded, BKN needs to get back more than just a couple rotation players and draft picks. You might think that's impossible now, but Morey sat on Ben Simmons for a while until something materialized. The worst possible outcome for BKN is if KD is traded away for pennies on the dollar, which is, of course, what everyone else wants. KD is signed until 2026, though. He'll be 38 by then. This contract encompasses what's left of his prime, so BKN absolutely has the power to destroy what's left of KD's legacy by letting him rot for the remainder of said contract. The Nets hold all the cards, not KD.

If BKN can't get back a haul for KD, then I'm cool with hanging onto him, even as his value diminishes over time. It's what he deserves after acting like a baby. He, along with Kyrie, had the keys to the franchise for 3 years, fucked it up, and now wants out. Laughable. The Nets FO is finally done with rewarding bad behavior (a  year or two too late, but that's water under the bridge now...), and if that means refusing to accommodate a disgruntled player's trade request, then so be it.

Honestly, it wouldn't be so bad to make an example out of him ahead of next year's CBA negotiations.

As for Kyrie, he's on an expiring contract, so whatever. If he needs to be dealt for scraps, then fine, but there's still time. Holding him into the regular season isn't a bad idea to see which teams are doing well, but just need that extra piece to make a deep playoff run. Also gives him time to bolster his trade value by playing and, well, not taking games off for whatever reason...",Nets,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vq0uev/wojnarowski_new_orleans_pelicans_star_zion/,0.9761,0.131,0.819,0.05

One thing I've loved about Simmons since I started listening to him (2009) is that he talks about sports in a fun way.  He isn't always right, but he has fun doing it, and his show is as good a mix of fandom and just enough analysis that it's worth listening to.  The alternative is the mass-produced ESPN-style podcasts which completely suck the fun out of sports.  It's like the difference between Inside the NBA and whatever the ESPN pre/post-game basketball show is.  ""Hey, here's a joke"" -- Yeah, but you all sound like you're reading that joke from a corporate-approved script.

2022-07-03,4trackboy,"If the team is that talented you should want KD even more, contend for a ring the next 3 seasons and still have some young infrastructure left to short-circuit a re-build once Durant falls off. Raptors can offer a great haul while maintaining depth and youth development. 


If you don't pull the trigger in this scenario the most likely thing to happen is none of your young guys will even remotely reach KDs level and you'll compete in the playoffs losing to teams that have a Giannis Tatum Embiid or short-term Butler and Harden on the squad. These guys will or have been MVPs or played like MVPs in the playoffs and in order to seriously contend you need one of these players on your team. Barnes might get there in 7 years but who's to say that he's not just bailing on Toronto like literally every All-NBA player has on this franchise? KD guarantees you 2-4 years of ATG playoff performance so you might as well have the balls and manifest another title run instead of growing sympathy for your home-grown players that 99% of the time won't make you actual contenders nor be as good as KD.

2022-07-03,Superball10,Leaves how? Kyrie opted in his final year. It's not like he can choose to become a free agent that option already passed. And next year lakers don't have the cap space to outright sign kyrie without him taking a major discount. Look buddy because I'm starting to lose patience with the fans thoughts here on r/nba on both the trades for Kd and kyrie. Nets hold all the cards. If they don't do the trades Kd and kyrie have close to no hope of going to their preferred destinations even next year. Kyrie could with a discount but if they're getting westbrook and barely a pick back they wouldn't do it. The deal is almost definitely Westbrook and two picks and maybe a salary dump. Lakers in their delusion are going to of course try to negotiate but it's a take it or leave it situation. I'm basically just a neutral fan but I'm suprised at the lack of common sense in this sub about things and the pure arrogance and entitlement of fans of different teams.,NA,-2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vq9bn9/begley_there_is_momentum_towards_a_kyrie/,-0.7265,0.054,0.854,0.092

If they don't do the trades Kd and kyrie have close to no hope of going to their preferred destinations even next year. Kyrie could with a discount but if they're getting westbrook and barely a pick back they wouldn't do it. The deal is almost definitely Westbrook and two picks and maybe a salary dump.

2022-07-03,karriganGOAT,"Did LeBron really call Klay one of the best two-way guys ever? Cmon man lol

**okay let's think about this then.**

I'm gonna list guys that were (a) clear positives on both offense & defense, and (b) clearly better at basketball than Klay Thompson. I think that fits the criteria of being a better two-way player. Let's see.

There are plenty more names I'd put here. I'd put prime Draymond Green on here over Klay - sure Klay's clearly better offensively but Dray's clearly better defensively while also being a positive on offense in his prime. Why should I have an inherent bias towards offense? But I just listed the ones that are irrefutable to make the point clear. 

This isn't even getting into guys like Paul George, Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler who were legitimate two-way #1 options at their best, a step ahead of Klay.

2022-07-03,solardeveloper,"People were doing this same meme about tech companies in 2000.  20 years later, tech companies influence every aspect of life.  I suspect blockchain and web3 will be similar.
