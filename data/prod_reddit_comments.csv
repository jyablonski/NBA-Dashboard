Did the Mavs win? ✅ Glad we managed to not choke away the lead again like last game

I'm used to Klay killing us but damn Moody seemed to fill in for him with 13(?) Points by him in the 4th 🌉

Luka with yet another strong first quarter tonight with 19pts and finished with another 40pt game & near triple double of 41/10/9/2 🔥🇸🇮4️⃣0️⃣

Powell was the unsung hero of tonight's win. Dude had like 4 baskets in the first half off of quick dimes from Luka, played some good defense, and crashed the boards hard with 3 offensive boards finishing with 13/8 7️⃣🏀

Brunson Burner with 14/3/4 ♨️

Doe Doe with another great showing of 18pts with 4 3's and the dagger layup 👌💦🗡️

Austin Reaves or Stanley Johnson are probably their hardest working players and they’re undrafted and a 2-way guy.

It sounds dumb but hear me out because it could work, we’ve seen agents become very successful GMs before. Bob Myers in Golden State. Rob Pelinka is an example himself! Rich has built an incredible rapport with Klutch clients and has the relationships and connections in NBA needed to make the Lakers great again! Then the next move is to bring Adele in as new Lakers head coach. Sounds stupid right? But remember Adele is Rich Paul’s girlfriend, and making sure your GM and coach have a good relationship is very important to building success. Also Adele has multiple Grammys, that means the players will be sure to LISTEN to her!

He's kind of what people dreamed Ben Simmons would do with his size, but actually tries to score.

Now, Luka is exploitable defensively in a different way than Steph. Steph is just small but Luka is pretty slow (another way in which his game is unique since he still gets shots off all the time).

A quality product means nothing in the big picture when Lakers games will always be the highest viewed, plus you add in Steph and it's a no brainer.

Reason being, consistently big viewership numbers allow the networks to charge an arm and a leg to advertisers, and they allow the NBA to do the same with the advertising around the arena.  Those network advertising profits are what allows for the tv deals to be so big, so going with the popular team will always trump airing games of the better but lesser known team.

Looked like the season was going nowhere. They're 15 and 3 since and now of course 11 games over .500. Defense has turned up a level and ball movement is noticably better. 22.8 ast/gm before, 27.2 since. Tatum is shooting better. The win pace probably isn't sustainable but I think the quality of play is. 

Sunday vs the Nets is the beginning of the home stretch of the season imo. Should have Jaylen back. Durant & Kyrie on the floor together with Seth & Drummond in the lineup for the first time.

“Then came an unending series of unfortunate events, beginning with Archibald tearing his Achilles 34 games into his Nets career. Bernard King was brilliant for a time with the Nets, but his battles with alcoholism quickly got him exiled to Utah, and after he straightened out, the Nets had to watch him become a folk hero across the Hudson.

Micheal Ray Richardson was a brilliant burst of energy … but that was before the three drug suspensions that ended his career at age 30. Chuck Daly once led a Nets revival behind Derrick Coleman and Kenny Anderson that seemed to be every bit as formidable as the one Pat Riley was building with the Knicks … until, one awful Sunday, Anderson went up for a layup, John Starks hammered him, Anderson broke his wrist and … well, that was that.

That came nine months after Drazen Petrovic, who became a crowd-pleasing star as a Net, was killed in an accident on the Autobahn in Germany. To this day Willis Reed, then the Nets’ GM, can’t speak of Petrovic without tearing up.””",Nets,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/t65jko/yes_network_breaking_joe_harris_out_for_the/,-0.7717,0.088,0.796,0.116

Part of this, for all these players, is because they also carry the offensive load so attack them.

Steph has undeniably good mechanics and did lead the league in steals. I try to look at effort and instinct over just saying dude's bigger so he's better. 

Besides, who you gonna exploit on a team (back in the day) that had like Draymond, Klay, Durant, and Igoudala on the court. Duh.

That being said, Luka's rebounding is the main case to say he could a better defender, but I think Luka's athleticism (like Jokic's too) is about being the initiator and not the one reacting, and therefore is quite poor at staying in front of athletic players.

But it's just my opinion, I could certainly be wrong.",NA,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/t69vmh/luka_doncic_vs_warriors_411092_steals_on_1526_fg/,-0.5189,0.094,0.811,0.096

They give up offensive rebounds more than you'd want. They get pushed around a bit by bigger guys. On the other hand, I'm starting to doubt how much that matters. The Warriors announcers were drooling over Powell, wanting a guy like him for their team. Maxi, at his best, is a 5 who can be a 38%+ 3pt shooter and stretch teams while still being the best defender on the roster.

I’m gonna try to speak for my fellow fans when I say the true animosity we have towards the lakers is how they can’t just enjoy their success without putting the clippers down and being obnoxious and toxic. I understand their are idiots in every base but it’s just crazy to sit here and see you spin it like you hate us cuz we hate you.

it's so fucking annoying watching a game winner or crazy dunk where the clip ends the second the ball goes in

we know they're rushing to get that karma. it brings the quality of everything down. or maybe it's literal kids doing these and don't know what a ""highlight"" is supposed to be.

If DFish's 0.4 happened today, we wouldn't get Duncan's crazy shot before or the Lakers sprinting into the tunnel. The clip would start as Payton is inbounding and would end as soon as the shot went in.

You absolutely do not want to be arguing post to post about why this clip that showed three seconds before the play is allowed to stay up while one that shows four seconds before the play got taken down. 

Hypothetically:

- Clip must be 14 seconds in length

- Must show at least seven seconds before and after the highlight itself (the moment the thing happened, like a block). 

- This are minimum requirements. Anything longer is fine.

I think that ""downvote isn't a disagree"" button might be sub specific, but ya I remember what you are talking about.

Even though I mock YouTube's decision to remove the downvote counter(because I personally think it was a response driven by corporations to hide extremely negative reception to their products) I think it could work better here.  It won't stop somebody downvoting a perfectly fine post just because they disagree, but it could help prevent the downvote bandwagon train.

This is silly reasoning tho. Yes, what you are describing might very well happen a handful of times in the first week or so that the new rule would be put in place..... however it would be a pretty temporary issue. 

Re: the deleted comment sections:

First of all, who the hell cares.. I’m not going to lose any sleep over the removal  of the first 2 minutes of comments from neckbeards f5ing the /new tab to spam whatever dumb meme of the moment is getting the most upvotes on a few random highlight clips. People who are *that* quick to post comments are 100% the same kind of people who are gonna repost their now-deleted comments on the new post anyways.

2nd of all, and more importantly, as soon as karma whoring highlight posters realize that there’s no point in wasting their time posting 3 second clips if they’re going to be immediately deleted and there efforts are going to be for nothing and some other highlight guy is going to get all the glory for waiting an extra 10 seconds to post his highlight, they will quickly adjust and be forced to post longer highlights if they still want to keep replenishing their lifeblood with the all important upvotes.

2022-03-04,rodrigo_c91,"Your question is honest in the sense that you’re genuinely curious. But it’s also dumb because you’re oblivious to understand that, while yes—he hasn’t won, he isn’t going away. He’s drastically changed the balance of power within the city and has legitimately made it a rivalry. Whereas it used to simply be a game viewed big brother vs little brother.

Regardless, we lakers fans can’t live in the past. Fact is, clippers WILL be competing so long as Ballmer remains faithful to his organization. He’s not spending money to make money in a greedy way. If anything, he’s naturally making money by fully investing on his team and allowing his front office to execute freely. They have superstars, legitimate role players, respected front office personnel, and an ever growing fan base which is not good. Not to mention he just fully dropped billion dollars on making their own turf to reinvent their image. Meanwhile lakers front office avoided luxury tax by freeing an excellent role player like caruso….

So yeah, he hasn’t accomplished any titles in 8 years. But is well positioned to succeed. Us on the other hand…our future is looking very bleak.

Steph's ahead in almost all the advanced stats I looked at, too (Backpicks BPM, EPM, LEBRON, RAPTOR, RPM).
