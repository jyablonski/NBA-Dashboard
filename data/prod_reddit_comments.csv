2022-05-22,Ask_Me_If_I_Suck,"NBA refs serve the purpose of keeping games close. No one can convince me otherwise. 

The Celtics got TWENTY free throws in the 1st half. The Heat had three. It was borderline unwatchable. The broadcasts don't even show the fouls half the time because they know as much as we do they are calling the smallest breath of contact to get the losing team to the line. And if they show it then the clips go viral shitting on refs. WHICH WE SHOULD BE.

Then they make it WORSE by fouling, inbounding, fouling, reviewing, timeout, inbounding, fouling, reviewing, technical free throws, penalty free throws, etc. for the last 3 minutes of the game. Completely ruining the flow and making the game take 30 minutes to play what should be the most exciting part in a close game. WHICH IS THE PRODUCT THEY ARE TRYING TO FORCE. They are literally officiating to make the last 2 minutes exciting and then make it boring as possible

I hate it. I'm done. I'm not watching this anymore. Which sucks because I love playing basketball, but this isn't even the same sport that I grew playing.

Edit: I genuinely don't understand how some people here can understand the Kings vs Lakers series was clearly fixed because of the 20+ ft's they called. But in this game it isn't. They just do it in the 1st half when less people are watching now.

2022-05-22,I_MILK_KITTENS_MILK,"Well yeah. These rings  9/10 have women make the first step of moves to obtain their victims. Either through friendship or just trusting initial relationships. Girls usually will trust a nicely dressed woman or someone that is their age more than they ever would a man. They can sometimes build relationships for weeks before actually going for the abduction. There was a very interesting case here in Pensacola where they (abductors) placed a girl in options school system and used her as a bridge to befriend a new girl in the system for a couple months. Finally the new girls parents agreed to let her spend the night after meeting her parents (the abductors). They trusted them. Within 72 hours she had been raped by over 12 men and sold on the internet for 220k. Her brother luckily found her at a gas station in orange beach Alabama on her way out of town. Sheer luck.

Speaking of, Jaylen is a fucking great player.

Why? Aside from the typical arguments against the death penalty (violates international law, insanely expensive, drain on the legal system, irreversible if the courts get it wrong, which they too often do), death is an out. Victims have to live with their trauma. Why should perpetrators not have to live with the consequences of their actions?

99.9% of the time it‚Äôs not some abduction like Taken.

They target underprivileged, vulnerable girls and form relationships, foster dependence (often through drugs), and gradually isolate them from their families/everyone else in their lives before cutting off all contact. 

Even this situation sounds like they had established the relationship prior, but thankfully the family found her, while many others don‚Äôt. 

It makes me sick, and it also makes me sick how so many people hear ‚Äúhuman trafficking‚Äù and think they‚Äôre fighting against abductions of suburban children off street corners (instances of which are virtually non existent), but do nothing to stop the true, dark reality of vulnerable teens being coerced and manipulated into *willingly* (although often out of ignorance) entering the sex trade.

He's at the point where he needs to prove he can actually stay on the court. He's spent almost the entire time since the bubble sitting out, ramping back up only to sit out again when he starts to look good. What about the rest of the team though? Oh nearly no assets, Westbrook and everyone old as shit. Odds are this Lakers team isn't crawling out of that hole until LeBron's contract is over and he's off to play with Bronny somewhere. If we were just talking LBJ and AD with actual assets and realistic trade scenarios to build a team around them like 2020 then sure they'd be great. That's not where the Lakers are though.

If I were LeBron I'd WANT them to trade me to a contender. Think about how it probably feels to be so good at that age still on top of all of that previous success and knowing that your team situation is in absolute shambles and you aren't actually sure for how many more years you've really still got this level of gameplay in you. I'd want to spend my last few good years really competing instead of competing for the play in and praying to god AD can stay on a basketball court.

If you're the lakers FO and you can get a good trade that LeBron agrees to, so that you don't look bad, I'd pull the trigger. Letting the contracts expire and rebuilding from there is way different than trading AD/Bron for major assets and building for the season after next when Westbrook is off the books probably cuts years off of the rebuild process. That has to look good as fuck when you're not even sure you can build a team to compete to begin with due to all of the above",76ers,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uushid/kyrie_on_legm_with_the_cavs_bron_was_behind_the/,0.9961,0.213,0.742,0.045

2022-05-22,d1g1tal,"Funny story, a few years ago a local radio station was doing a giveaway for the chance to be a ball boy the my Celtics. I thought, what the hey, I'll enter this stupid twitter thing and forget about it. 

Two days later, I get a DM from the Celtics account and we coordinate on which game I got chosen for. Anxious as fuck as that big day is nearing. 

Get to the stadium, and it's super disorganized. No one wants to help me out, I literally ask anyone who would make eye contact at the stadium. You won't believe who made eye contact (finally), helped me out and got me in position to rebound... My man Jaylen Brown. 

After a quick chat, I start delivering two-handed passes that are as crisp as my grandma‚Äôs baked ziti. JB and I lock eyes and boom, he receives the ball in the perfect position. He moves right, I move right. He glances at the next spot and I deliver it with ease. 

We went a while, back and forth, pass and shoot, ball in hand to ball in basket. After a 20 minute shoot around, he can see I'm at my ball-handling limit. Jay was very generous and offered a full Celtics jumpsuit (since I was mad sweaty). I thank him but decline to change on the court. 

JB told me the locker room is available for guests right now. We take a stroll into the tunnel and he directs me to his fucking locker! My boys at home are gonna be wicked pumped at the photos I planned to take! 

As I begin to undress, Jaylen mentions that it'll be better to travel back home in not only clean clothes but a clean self. He walks me over to the shower and let's me have my privacy.

Man, what a day and what a great guy, I thought. I'd do anything for Jaylen, he really gave me a once in a lifetime experience. Just thinking about it got me excited, NGL. As I'm lathering up, I feel the presence of another person. 

It's Jaylen and he's an inch from my face. At this point, I've got kinda a boner from how tense it was. Then, I look down. 

Jaylen‚Äôs completely soft.

Now, factor in the quality of the supporting cast, depleted draft picks, and cap situation, then look at the state of the conference.

He can penetrate a bit better and has a little more quickness to guard opposing guards and wings. Otherwise, he doesn't give them much that Barnes didn't.

If Barnes didn't shoot 10% from the field over the last 4 games of those Finals, Golden State probably wins.

I was a teemage runaway. 
The reality is if they would need an entire new division (and accompanying funding) if they were to treat every teenage runaway as a kidnapping.

When I was a runaway  living woth other runaways, I had a good friend I was hanging out with who we found posters from the Institute for Missing And Exploited Children with him on it that we found in a record shop. We hung it up in our squat because we thought it was amusing (he found it amusing too.)

He was running away from an abusive father and we weren't about to call them to take him back against his will. (He later reunited moved back in with his mom when his mom left the father)

Out and out kidnapping is ridiculously rare, even for teenagers living on the streets. Most teenagers know how to dial 911 if they want to be found unless it's some kind of rare horrific case of someone litterally being held captive (or immigrants who are afraid of contact with authorities for whatever reason). ""Trafficking"" is very broad and usually way more complicated, dealing with more subtle issues of consent than someone being outright held captive.",NA,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uupl72/teen_girl_trafficked_from_mavericks_game_found_10/,-0.25,0.077,0.851,0.072

2022-05-22,americanbeaver,They play both sides of physicality. They play very physical basketball and complain about other team's matching their physicality. Grant Williams was legit leaning his entire body weight on Giannis and KD off ball. Then they flop like they get shot on any drive or post-up. A frustrating team to watch play. They got away with murder beating up on KD off ball then bitched and whined about physicality and how they get no calls in the Bucks series.

2022-05-22,AutisticNipples,"it‚Äôs always more expensive than life in prison.  And its not even close. 

obviously the court system wants to make sure it isn‚Äôt making a mistake, so you have a much more arduous and expensive appellate process.

not to mention that death row is much more expensive because it‚Äôs segregated from the general prison population. It costs CA $100,000 more per year to house a single prisoner on death row compared to a life sentence in gen pop.

plus, you‚Äôre on death row for an average of nearly 20 years before execution. 


A 2008 study of the California system found that the cost of the death sentence to tax payers was $140 million per year. If the death penalty was abolished, the annual cost of all death row prisoners instead having a life sentence would be $11 million per year.  

It‚Äôs literally more than ten times as expensive to sentence someone to death than to lock them up for life.",Knicks,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uupl72/teen_girl_trafficked_from_mavericks_game_found_10/,-0.9921,0.04,0.717,0.243

Likewise, if she wasn't drugged and she was alert, all it would take would be a scream or a call for help for the situation to be ended. And it's a sporting event in America so it's not like someone could have held her at gun point and forced her to comply. Even pocket knives are banned.

I cannot think of any scenario in which she did not leave the building under her own free will. Romeo tactics would make sense. No other type of coercion would.

What y'all should really be arguing about it why stuff like this is happening, how it's happening, and what we can do to stop it.

2022-05-22,cosmotheassman,"""What can you really not like about him?‚Äù

Well, for starters, I can't fucking stand the mouthguard thing. Is it in or out? I don't know about the average NBA fan, but I personally could go without seeing 50 shots a game of a 35-year-old man gnawing on a mouthguard like it's a goddamn pacifier. Wanna chew on something? Fine. Have some gum like MJ or stick a fucking plastic straw in your mouth like Caron Butler - just spare us from the mouthguard. 

But that is a minor annoyance compared to the showboaty, frontrunner, shimmy shimmy bullshit that he and some of the other Warriors do. It's one thing to see a player you dislike make a key bucket and scream in the air with excitement and adrenaline coursing through his veins. I can live with a fist pump, or a chest slap, or that thing where two guys run up to each other and jump in the air to bump chests or sides or whatever. That's part of the game. But am I a crusty old hater when I dislike seeing a guy shimmy and dance around the court after seeing him hit his 6th three (out of 16 attempts)? Do we need a wiggle after every other made basket, or a 'bed time' pose after a game one win at home? Furthermore, should Steph really be the guy with the pass to behave that way on the court when his success has been driven largely by the fact that he has played alongside another one of the greatest shooters of all-time in Klay and an all-time defensive player and facilitator in Draymond? Oh and KD. 

Eh, fuck it, I don't care either way. Steph is fucking obnoxious, he's never been nor ever will be a "" throw him out there with a group of five scrubs and you got a chance against anyone"" player, and his impact on the way the game is played is vastly overrated. The three-point revolution has as much to do with Daryl Morey and the 2012-2014 Spurs as it does Steph. Also, put my team in a tight game vs the Warriors and I'm more worried about Klay in the final minutes.

2022-05-22,OneBigRed,"According to Stu Jackson, they nixed the trade for being too good for the Pelicans:

>	‚Äú[Stern] ‚Äúran things by me, as an ex-general manager at the time. I explained to David the following ‚Ä¶ I felt that the package of Odom, Martin, Scola, Dragic was going to vault the New Orleans Hornets to a position where they‚Äôd make the playoffs but they were going to be a playoff team that was not capable of winning a championship.

>	‚ÄúIn other words, I thought so much of Monty Williams, I thought he would coach them up and get in the playoffs, not have home-court advantage and fans would be happy, obviously, but they would be caught in mediocrity and a mediocre team is not necessarily attractive to a potential owner. They want lesser payroll, they want to put their stamp on the team and build it and by making this trade, to me it made the franchise unattractive, or less attractive, to a potential owner. And to my surprise after another day David kind of got his head wrapped around it and he agreed. He made the decision to veto the trade and not approve.‚Äù

It sure was the better package in hindsight:

Los Angeles Lakers: PG Chris Paul (from NO Hornets)

New Orleans Hornets: F Lamar Odom (from LA Lakers), SG Kevin Martin (from HOU Rockets), PF Luis Scola (from HOU Rockets), PG Goran Dragic (from HOU Rockets)

Houston Rockets: PF Pau Gasol (from LA Lakers)

This year: 11% shots from 0-3 ft

2022-05-22,BigBussyBenny,"It‚Äôs perspective and bias, and if we were in his position we‚Äôd feel the same way. 

It reminds me of when‚Ä¶ correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but the sixers shot like 20 more ft than the raptors and someone on the sixers said post game they should‚Äôve shot 20 more ft with ‚Äúhow much they foul‚Äù. Problem is Siakam had so many no calls if you want a robot doing this job then they‚Äôd shoot 20 more ft and Siakam alone would‚Äôve shot 22 more ft that game. 

But no one thinks they fouled. Everyone thinks they got fouled. Human nature. 

The heat see this quote and laugh, and can probably point out a shit ton of times they were hacked too with no calls. 

What makes a champion, in part, is keeping a cool head even if you‚Äôre done dirty. Draymond getting himself ejected (remind me of the year) to give the Cavs momentum should‚Äôve taught us all that. Refs fuck up, you can talk to them about it. Fixate on it? Your head is in the wrong game, and if you‚Äôre a star you‚Äôre already costing your team the game. 

Biased ofc but that‚Äôs what I think that 2019 raps champ team had going for them big time. Kawhi rarely argued. Nick said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll complain for you‚Äù. I remember Marc getting mad 1 time all season. They kept cool heads and honestly that Bucks team didn‚Äôt do that. Giannis learned now, no more ‚Äúdark Giannis‚Äù, but for a bit he let stuff like that get to him. Keeping your head right is super important.

2022-05-22,DylanCarlson3,"> yet people on here will claim Bron doesn‚Äôt really control the front office.

There's a difference between blaming LeBron for roster failures because you literally believe he is the actual GM, and understanding he is an all-time great player with enormous sway who will certainly be able to suggest players to his FO.

Do you really think that, if Giannis went to the Bucks FO and said ""we could really use a player like XYZ"" that the Bucks FO would just laugh at him and tell him to get back in the gym and worry about playing? Not a chance. They'd AT LEAST take a look at salary, what it'd take to trade for that player, etc. and consider it immediately. That's not saying they'd automatically do it just because Giannis said so, but you're crazy if you think this doesn't happen with every team that has a superstar on its roster to some degree.",SuperSonics,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uushid/kyrie_on_legm_with_the_cavs_bron_was_behind_the/,-0.2695,0.061,0.871,0.068

They also have several years of practice against the exact style of offense that the mavs play (slow pace, iso heavy, 3 point shooters surrounded by a ball dominant superstar, these mavs play extremely similar to hardens rockets). 

The mavs also don‚Äôt force many turnovers, which is golden states main weakness. They have no interior defense, so if the warriors go cold from 3 they can very easily get going inside.

Also the mavs literally played almost perfectly in game 2, they had absurdly hot 3 point shooting in the first half, Luka had a signature game and didnt turn the ball over as much, they had two non-Luka players combine for over 50, and their hot 3 point shooting honestly didnt even subside that much in the second half, they didnt go cold.

2022-05-22,LosAngelesLosers,"I think Luka has a ways to go to improve on the defensive end. His roster needs better balance to avoid him having to shoulder 90% of the offensive load. I also don‚Äôt think Luka really makes his teammates better yet. He absolutely gets them lots and lots of open looks, but the heliocentric nature of his game means no one else ever develops a rhythm. Same problem with hardens rockets. It takes a special kind of dude (pj Tucker prototype) that can thrive only ever playing catch and shoot on offense and killing themselves on defense. I‚Äôll admit to being a Stephew but I think he‚Äôs underrated on defense.

Either way how cool is it to have this much elite talent in the league? I remember like a decade where the only debate was what order to put kobe Bron and kd.

2022-05-22,Sufferix,"I don't hate Steph Curry, I hate three-point shooting and the result of advanced analytics, and I recognize Curry as the catalyst for this ideology change (a.k.a. I blame Steph for the current NBA).

I think the final product of this current era of basketball is coming to fruition--endless blowouts. All games are basically coming down to three-point shooting, and if one team is hot, and the other team is not, the game is over. This shit is extremely boring.

Most people come without a solution but I believe we should switch all two-pointers to threes and all threes to fours. This isn't an original concept but the point is it devalues the point increase from current 2-to-3P shooting so that the conversion rate on in-arc shots becomes less and the conversion rate from behind the line becomes higher.

Some simple math with minimal explanation:

* Average Points-Per-Possession (PPP) in 2022 is 1.13
* The difference in shooting percentage to reach it based off points awarded per shot is the differential (% diff)
* If the points awarded per shot go up, the PPP would go up; estimated at 1.6

&#x200B;

Current NBA1.13 PPP = 56.5% 2P | 37.7% 3P

>1.6 PPP = 80% 2P | 53% 3P  
>  
>% Diff @ 1.13 = 18.8%  
>  
>% Diff @ 1.6 = 27%

&#x200B;

Future NBA

>1.13 PPP = 37.7% 2P | 28.2% 3P  
>  
>1.6 PPP = 53% 2P | 40% 4P  
>  
>% Diff @ 1.13 = 9.5%  
>  
>% Diff @ 1.6 = 13%

&#x200B;

Some commentary:

1. There are 31 players who shot 56.5% or higher but 54 who shot 53% or higher (+74% change) from two in the 21-22 season.
2. There are 73 players who shot 37.7% or higher but only 25 who shot 40% (-64% change) or higher (Steph Curry shot 37.9% this year) in the 21-22 season.
3. You will need to change shooting fouls as no one wants to wait for three shots each time (Giannis would take over a minute to shoot three times).
4. Historical data will just need to be converted up (Wilt 100pt is now 140pt).

&#x200B;

Extra commentary:

**#3** I have two separate proposals for this. I would much rather a foul be ball back with full shot clock and get to do a play again. This has huge implications on the game but there's not a single person who would say their favorite part of basketball is foul shooting. It's a skill though and taking it out of the game removes a skill. A more moderate proposal would be all shooting fouls as one FT and the ball back. This keeps the requirement to shoot FTs as important, though significantly less, and gives us more actual basketball. This also completely changes the end-game strategy but, again, no one likes the commercial timeout, quick inbound play, foul, however long for FTs, commercial timeout, quick inbound play, foul again sequence.

**#4** Wilt would actually score more if FTs stayed the same. If the data is good enough, you know how many FTs were and-ones, how many were two-shot FTs, and you can just use a conversion rate on his FTs to give him a true point value.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I don't know why I wrote this to begin with. I'm not the greatest basketball mind, I'm also not good at math, and I don't know how many people even dislike current basketball paradigm.

2022-05-22,BigBussyBenny,"Don‚Äôt forget that children frequent the sub. Lowry could average 8 and 5 and simply having a coach on the floor like that organizing the team, directing traffic, and controlling pace is so huge. 

People can‚Äôt fathom the idea that setting up a play where you get neither the score or assist is not only doable but incredibly valuable, and anyone who played even senior hs ball should know it. 

This kind of comes down to Lowry and Smarts health in my mind. Smart provides so much defence, and pushes his team through example in such a way that it‚Äôs incredible to see. My pick for DPOY tbh.

Lowry, like I said, is out there breaking down your defence and offence simply with what he tells his players. He doesn‚Äôt even need the ball and he can see it better than most players can and relay that while on the floor.

2022-05-22,seattIekraken,"Been actually calling him out on possibly being a pseudo intellectual on the celtics sub for a while now(couple years) . Some of his statements during the BLM movement/riots were more akin to pro-black than actual BLM(not to the extent of Stephen Jackson obviously he was actually pro-black + anti-Semitic) but still it raised a red flag back then. Or even just him saying ""it was important to hire a black coach"". Sorry but no it's not, what's important is that you get the best coach available regardless of his skin colour(which to be clear Ime was 100% the right choice, he's been fucking amazing). Now with the context of racism and whatnot, I wasn't convinced yet but gave him a pass.

That being said with the whole covid/vaccination thing, there was no more maybe. Dude straight up refused to say if he was vaccinated. Refused to encourage people to get vaccinated, he basically dodged the questions a la kyrie ironically. Then he said that he believes in some dumb astrological stuff(planet retrograding which is some dumb jumbo mumbo). And recently before the playoffs, he came out and mentionned how he's gotten close to kyrie recently(they disliked each other when they played together) and how kyrie is a friend, a brother. What do they have in common? Believing in some dumb shit, being anti-vaxx(even tho still to this day he refused to tell anyone if he was vaccinated or not or still is who knows). Both of them act as pseudo intellectual so here you have it.

Ngl, it's kinda hard to cheer for him when you know he's most likely a complete idiot acting like he's smart(kyrie 2.0).

Meanwhile, Tatum did the draymond green podcast and you couldn't love a player more than him, what a great dude.

2022-05-22,WIN011,">why are you complaining then?   
  
Uhhh maybe cause the Celtics shot significantly more FTs tonight? Is that really such a hard concept to understand? The Bucks, Heat, and Celtics all play physical defense and get away with things but then you have stretches where one team gets way more FTs.   
  
Vincent pushes off on Theis and they call an offensive foul then a couple plays later Brown pushes off on Vincent and they don‚Äôt call anything. On top of that they give a very weak technical to Vincent. Celtics shot the final 17 FTs in game 3 against us and Udoka is still crying about it postgame. Tonight Brown shoots 12 FTs, more than the Heat until the intentional fouls come in, and he‚Äôs crying about it postgame.   
  
Like I said y‚Äôall are an incredibly talented team but whenever there‚Äôs a loss or the team doesn‚Äôt play well they bitch about this or that. Just incredibly unlikeable. I got no issue losing to a better team but that doesn‚Äôt mean I have to like all the complaining they do. How would you like if Giannis spent every single postgame bitching and moaning how he never gets calls after shooting 15+ FTs? That‚Äôs what Brown is doing here.

Celtics players were grabbing and holding Giannis on drives so no surprise they would get some physicality back in return. Then you get the Celtics crying after all their games when Giannis didn‚Äôt say shit.  
  
It‚Äôs almost like every single Celtics fan that has responded to me didn‚Äôt actually read what I said. I don‚Äôt care that they let the foul on smart go just don‚Äôt call it the other way when he falls over.

This team has a seriously pathetic victim complex about reffing and they only make it harder for themselves. There's a legitimate argument that Tatum (and to a much lesser degree Brown) don't get nearly as favorable a whistle as other players of their caliber, but tonight its fucking delusional to complain about refs given the disparity of free throws in the Celtics' favor. just shut the fuck up, u moron, i hope you get fined

Im so sick and tired of seeing Tatum and Jaylen (and fucking Grant Williams) bitching and moaning all game and not hustling back when theres no chance the refs were gonna reverse their call anyway. Tatum flailing like a dumbass every drive actively masks the fact of when he does get hacked, which dumbfuck convinced him that playing like Embiid will get him the Embiid treatment.

2022-05-22,ZeekLTK,"I was tall enough to always be forward, sometimes center (rare), but (on accident) I was ahead of the curve regarding outside shooting. The reason was that one time I got hurt when driving to the basket - I hurt my ankle really bad and was out for like 4-5 months - so after that I *never* tried to drive ever again (unless it was so open that I could expect no one to contest). But, unless you were someone who played against me all the time AND paid enough attention to realize that I *never* drove to the basket, I could always get an open look by *pretending* I was going to drive and then hitting a step back three or a mid range jumper or whatever. It was always open because every defender was trying to make sure I won't go past them, but jokes on them - I was never going to try to go past them anyways. lol

I remember one pickup game, late 90s or early 00s or whatever - I hit like 5 mid range jumpers on this guy, and after we won I overheard him telling his buddy ""fuck man, I did my job on D, he didn't get by me once, I forced him to keep shooting jump shots, not my fault he made like all of them"" and I was just laughing thinking ""you idiot, that was the shot I *wanted*!""",Pistons,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uuqsdl/matt_barnes_if_you_dont_like_steph_curry_then/,0.4097,0.137,0.748,0.115

2022-05-22,Vitis_Vinifera,"I think this is a misperception of how Curry has changed offense.  There are lazy teams who live and die by the 3, because it's easier to just chuck one up with 15 seconds left on the shot clock than working the ball around and finding the open man - whether it's at the 3 point line, or a cutter.

Curry has unprecedented range, and also a very fast release. But it's still within Kerr's offense which is heavy on passing and off-ball movement.  If the Warriors were fuck it chuck it, they wouldn't have 3 rings, should have had 4, and are well in contention for this season's championship.",Warriors,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uuqsdl/matt_barnes_if_you_dont_like_steph_curry_then/,-0.54990000000000006,0.072,0.817,0.111

What's funny to me is that my area had 3 grade schools, mine being the smallest, but we would always shoot threes.

Your own beat writer even said after game 5 against us that there were several instances of Celtics players complaining to officials and not getting back which led to 3s.   
  
They‚Äôre very good players but the Celtics absolutely complain more than the average team. And yes Tucker flops and complains a lot too he did that here.
