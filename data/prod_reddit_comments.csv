2022-05-28,narmerguy,"With all due respect, no one who watched the NBA at that time would say these games are comparable. That Lebron game was the culmination of so many storylines being squashed and demons being exorcised, and facing a team that had a known championship core as well. 

The weight of that game, if the heat lost it, probably that team was going to get blown up. Everyone thought this was going to be yet another playoff loss for the supposed best player in the league and instead he delivered one of the greatest and eeriest playoff performances of all time. People often don't remember that he did not sub out a single minute of that game until the last 3 minutes when Boston was so thoroughly demolished that it was basically garbage time. I've never seen a game like that from Lebron, and the look in his eyes is basically iconic now.

>I don‚Äôt know what happened. I just know the shots wouldn‚Äôt stop going in. After about the fifth dagger in a row (he made 10 straight), the crowd started groaning on every make ‚Äî shades of Philly‚Äôs Andrew Toney ripping our hearts out 30 years ago. If you‚Äôve ever been in the building for one of those games, you know there isn‚Äôt a deadlier sound. He single-handedly murdered one of the giddiest Celtics crowds I can remember. Thirty points in the first half. Thirty! All with that blank look on his face. It was like watching surveillance video of a serial killer coldly dismembering a body and sticking the parts in the fridge. Only we were right there.  
>  
>You can‚Äôt imagine what this was like to witness in person. I know Michael Jordan had similarly astonishing games, and others, too, but not with stakes like that. This wasn‚Äôt just an elimination game. This was LeBron James‚Äôs entire career being put on trial ‚Ä¶ and it only took an hour for him to tell the jury, ‚ÄúGo home. I‚Äôm one of the best players ever. Stop picking me apart. Stop talking about the things I can‚Äôt do. Stop holding me to standards that have never been applied to any other NBA player. Stop blaming me for an admittedly dumb decision I never should have made. Stop saying I‚Äôm weak. Stop saying that I don‚Äôt want to win. Stop. Just ‚Ä¶ stop.‚Äù  
>  
>As a Celtics fan, I was devastated. As a basketball fan, I appreciated the performance for what it was. One of the greatest players ever was playing one of his greatest games ever. He swallowed up every other relevant story line. Needless to say, the Celtics couldn‚Äôt match him ‚Äî especially Pierce, who‚Äôs worn down from four weeks of battling Andre Iguodala, Shane Battier and LeBron on one leg and appears to be running on fumes of his fumes‚Äô fumes at this point. The fans were so shell-shocked that many (including me and my father) filed out with three minutes remaining, not because we were lousy fans, not to beat the traffic, but because we didn‚Äôt want to be there anymore. We wanted to get away from LeBron. He ruined what should have been a magical night. We never really had a chance to cheer, swing the game, rally our guys, anything.

2022-05-28,jeffthenarwhal666,"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  
  
I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  
  
I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  
  
and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  
  
I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  
  
he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  
  
and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  
  
I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  
  
until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  
  
edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass.",Warriors,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uzeqr5/post_game_thread_the_miami_heat_33_force_a_game_7/,0.9498,0.085,0.862,0.053

2022-05-28,DogtoothKatakuri,"To be fair to Jimmy, it really looked like he was focused on the game and none of the things around him. Although I joked in the game thread that Dray's reverse Psychology worked, I'd believe what he said about not letting the media noise get into him. There were questionable calls on both sides and I didn't see it affect him that much while the rest of the players were losing their minds. I wasn't able to follow their games but from watching this game alone, I believe he was telling the truth. 

The opposite of what I noticed with Luka when the other team is playing great. You can tell it affects his game. I left a comment on the game thread yesterday how important it was for Steve Kerr to tell the team to not let the great shots of the Mavs affect their game in the first half.

2022-05-28,kneeco28,"If you had home advantage in a best-of-7 and could decide which 4 games to (potentially) host, which would you choose?

You have to choose before the series and can't change midstream.

When I have asked this question to people, they always include game 7, but I think that's a mistake. Game 7s don't happen all that often and game 6, which happens way more often, is necessarily a 3-2 potential close-out affair.

So I am tempted to forego game 7. Also, I never want to be at a point in the series where there's been more away games than home, so I'm definitely taking game 1.

Finally, I don't think you want to ever have a situation of playing three straight on the road in a best of seven, so I don't think you can take 1-4, even though it's the only way to guarantee you get all your home games and gives you a chance to win without travel.

I think 1, 2, 4, 5 makes a lot of sense and maybe is the mathematically correct answer (especially if we're considering a subsequent round benefit of shorter earlier rounds). But I just can't get over the possibility of going on the road for both 6 and 7. 

So I think my answer is 1, 2, 4, 6. You get that crucial potential game 6, always have more games on your court then theirs, and never give them even the potential for back to back home games.

The constant travel might increase variance though, which you don't want as the home advantage team.",Raptors,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uyxp10/daily_discussion_thread_game_thread_index/,0.984,0.131,0.843,0.026

There was a time he called bosh over for a screen and didn't even look at him just waved him over. Like it's seriously nothing i've ever seen before not just from him but any player.

2022-05-28,6lackDino,"Crypto outside the 3-4 major players is a pyramid scheme. 

In fact, you could even argue outside of Bitcoin and ethereum everything is a pyramid scheme.

Even Bitcoin only really has first-movers advantage and no real value in the non-black market world. Transactions take too long and gas fees are too high.

Knew when he looked up at the rim like you look at a ref when you dont get a call after his 2nd airball it was over

Jimmy isn‚Äôt a superstar

It's insane how Jimmy successfully brainwashed people into thinking he's some clutch god that carried his team to the Finals in 2020 (absolutely not true even though he was great in the Finals)

Said it before and I'll say it again. He isn't a superstar.

Tobias Harris over me‚Ä¶. I‚Äôll take Tobias tbh. Jimmy isn‚Äôt what he was in the bubble anymore. He a subpar scorer that can get locked up by good defenders. 

Tbh I don't think he's a playoff superstar as the media says he is. He's a really good player but short of the superstar you need especially when his co stars are not producing. He can‚Äôt carry a team like other players.

Kawhi has had 2 healthy seasons. 1 of which he had a fantastic, ATG level run and won the title (2019). The best we‚Äôve seen dude for a full run. The other season saw him flame out when he and his team committed one of the biggest chokejobs in NBA history and blew a 3-1 lead to Denver (2020).

He was shaping up to have great runs in 2017 and 2021 but got injured in both and because of said injuries, he missed the 2018 and 2022 seasons pretty much entirely.

2022-05-28,Fanott,"Any great performances by a player with an illness will be compared to MJ's flu game.

Any 3-1 finals chokejob will be compared to the 2016 finals. 

Any 20+ missed 3s will be compared to the Rockets 27 missed 3s. 

You don't need many things to be exactly the same for 2 things to be comparable. You're completely missing the point. By your logic, nothing in this world is comparable.  Dirk had fever, MJ had flu. Dirk played for Mavs against the heat, MJ played for the Bulls against the Jazz. MJ is the GOAT and Dirk isn't. Dirk is a PF, MJ is a SG. Dirk is European, MJ is an American. One is in 97 and one is on 2011. So are those 2 games not comparable?

Edit: If you're so horny to insist that context matters for 2 things to be comparable, then using your example, how does Lowry or Derozan compare to Lebron? Lebron got hyped up since he was high school. Lebron is the face of this generation. Lebron choked in the previous finals. Lebron left his hometown team to create a ""super team"". No one really gives 2 shits about Lowry or Derozan. One is a generational talent who has a career defining legacy game while Lowry/Derozan are just all stars. I don't know why you're choosing specific things to insist that they have to be the same for 2 things to be comparable while neglecting so many other things.

After Miami lost people was celebrating them losing to Dallas. Lebron cameback and 2 historic MVP seasons. Then won with Cleveland which really boosted his ranking all time. Same with Kobe he was a 3 time champion but winning 2 more without Shaq really did a lot for him.

The Mavs had some really good veterans to help Dirk, but weren't nearly as deep as that Raptors team.

Give me one wish, and it'll be Sixers fans opening their eyes and realizing that everything they complain about from the Raptors that series Embiid was doing the same but multiplied. Bitching about the refs? Embiid seems to not have taken his own advice to Nick Nurse. Siakam doing a rip-through on the euro step? Embiid and Harden both literally do that exact same move regularly, and Embiid elbowed multiple Raptors players in the series, four thrown elbows in just Game 1 alone. Siakam's driving past Tobias Harris which Embiid saw and left Scottie Barnes, who was just at the edge of the logo when Siakam went into his move, to drop down to help on the drive which forced Siakam into going for the euro step in which he brought the ball over (which is a regular basketball move) resulting in Embiid getting hit in the face with the elbow and then putting the ball up for the **incorrectly** called And-One which was then **correctly** overturned to an offensive foul being a frustration foul? Embiid literally dove into Siakam's midsection after Siakam called for a timeout in Game 4 down 12 with 3:06 left in the game, that is an actual frustration foul. Embiid shoving Boucher with his forearm when he was turned facing the other way in a similar manner to Jokic doing to Morris was also a clear frustration and dirty foul. I don't even have to get into star fouls when you got Embiid AND Harden on your team.

2022-05-28,twistedmind25,"I agree with 1, 3, 4, 5, but different reasoning. 

I agree with OP about game 7 not being worth it since it rarely happens. 

Going backwards:

5 is guaranteed to either be a series clinching game for one team or put a team on the brink of elimination. Regardless of what side you‚Äôre on in those scenarios, want it at home. 

4 is a momentum game. Avoiding or finishing a sweep, you want to be at home. Up 2-1 you want to push a team to the brink, make it hard as possible for them to win. Down 2-1 you don‚Äôt want to go to the brink, give yourself all the advantages. 

3 you want because you‚Äôre either down 0-2, tied, or up 2-0. Going down 0-3 is a death knell, so being home is better than not. Tied you want at home to increase odds of going up 2-1. Up 2-0 you want at home to go for the jugular and push a team to the brink. 

1 you want because it increases the chances of going up 1-0 in the series. Winning 3 out of 6 is easier than 4 out of 6 after that point, obviously.

6 and 7 you take your chances. Games are so intense I wouldn‚Äôt buy into HCA meaning much anyways.

Things can change and with any other player I'd take it with a grain of salt, but, I think all Nuggets fans and everyone around the organization feel very differently about those sentiments when Jokic says them. It's abundantly clear how important staying with one franchise is to him, and how unmotivated he is by chasing a legacy. 

In what he says and how he acts it seems very clear that staying in Denver and trying to win with the people here, including some of our staff members who are the closest with Jokic, is more fulfilling to him even if it doesn't result in a championship than going somewhere else just to have a better chance to win. I would bet my life savings on the idea of asking to be traded or forcing a trade would never even cross his mind. Not that any team would have enough assets to entice the FO for trading a B2B MVP in his prime anyway.

Throw GPII on Brown and Wiggins on Tatum. Give Steph help against Smart and have Draymond cover the C and have him help on Brown.

2019 they did have Butler, they lost to Toronto.

2020 would be their best chance, but the bubble was weird, Ben Simmons was out (if they kept Simmons with Butler and discarded Harris / Horford). They would be my pick out of the East, but I wouldn't say they were favorites against the Lakers. Also as far as I can remember, Joel Embiid in 2020 was not the same Joel Embiid as today. Very good player, yes. MVP caliber player, probably not.

2021 they probably would beat the Hawks, but with Embiid playing on an injury and Simmons having his mental issues, I will probably still pick the Bucks in the ECF.

2022-05-28,SkyFoo,"eh, I don't think football is particularly worse than any other light contact sport as a whole, diving and foul baiting problems are either team or singular players problems (getafe and neymar as some of the most known examples) but I remember a match not long ago (maybe Villarreal-Liverpool) where I don't think a single foul was called in like 40 minutes and it was a pretty physical but clean game.

as any other sport it just depends on the ref, the team the player, but I gotta say when the game comes near it's end the non stop clock is an issue as teams sell more fouls and stay on the floor longer.

now I've realized I went on kind of a tangent but addressing that point, I think with football being a more physical sport than basketball say (they allow for more/harder contact) in order to sell fouls you can't just act as if you were pushed too strong as it happens in basketball but as if you got seriously kicked, its annoying but I don't mind as long as the ref isn't buying it or they stop, definitely a worse look though",NBA,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uzcehe/highlight_epic_kyle_lowry_flop_against_horford/,0.443,0.107,0.789,0.103

I genuinely love both of these teams to death. Celtics are my all time number one, the warriors are are number two. 

Every time they play each other in the regular season I feel sick to my stomach, I hate watching my two favorite teams win but obviously a bit more happy when the Celtics win or a bit more unhappy when the Celtics lose. 

I‚Äôve been dreading this since last round that my two teams would be playing each other in the finals and that one side is going to end up incredibly disappointed is very hard and confusing to process because I am such a strong fan of both teams. 

Ride with me Cs till I die but the pleasure is decreased in winning against a team I do also actually love.

I‚Äôm not a fan of either team but that series convinced me the nba fixes games to extend series. Like the warriors so obviously outclassed them that series should have been warriors in five. You can argue draymond did deserve to be suspended but he was not going to be until lebron asked. And I remember just laughing in game six when they tried to eject Steph as fast as possible, it was just so absurd how they weren‚Äôt even trying to hide that the fix was in. Cavs stepped up in game 7 though. 

That‚Äôs the only reason I was glad KD joined. A three year period where he had no chance at winning the finals because of the ring the refs handed him on a silver platter in 2016

I think your 1,2,4,5 makes more sense than 1,2,4,6. There's more chance of recuperating for the home team. And if your team is aware that early games decides the series, they can go all out and just accept the fact that if they can't close out before game 6, the series is lost.",NA,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uyxp10/daily_discussion_thread_game_thread_index/,0.8458,0.12,0.828,0.052

Mbappe, Messi and Cristian Ronaldo are outliers. Two of the latter are the greatest players to ever play the game and Mbappe is a potential all time great playing for an overpaying team that is owned by the Qatari government. 

NBA players by enlarge make a lot more money. You got below average NBA players easily raking in $50-$60 million dollars in career earnings. 

You have guys like Gorgui Dieng doing $71 million in career earnings and still going. 

This is unheard of for most soccer players. The English Premier League is the richest leave in the world. An above average player in England is earning $2-$8 million a year. Only a handful make over $20 million. 

There is no such thing as super max or veteran or rookie contract. You get paid based on your performance and the club you play for.

But I don't know how the Ligue One (France top football league) works with salaries.

2022-05-28,MadManMax55,"The whole thing is literally built on malice. The pitch these celebrities give to get people to buy their meme coins is ""If all of you buy it, then the value will go up, which will cause more people to buy, which will make the value go up, till it goes 'to the moon'. But since you bought low, you can sell to all the suckers getting in late for a huge profit.""

I'll give you that the people buying the meme coins likely don't think they're doing anything wrong.

In the NBA finals against the best of the best? He‚Äôs comparatively average. Worse on ball defender than Steph this season and worse team defense.)

2022-05-28,photowanderer,"Exactly, I was looking through to see if anyone make this comment. The context leading up to the game was very different. LeBron had all the pressure in the world, career-defining game after the previous year failure against the Mavs.

Leading up to this was the ridicule from the finals against the Mavs of how LeBron doesn't have the clutch gene and disappeared in the 4th quarter. This coupled with the infamous heatles press conference ""not 1, not 2, not 3,..."" were the classic jokes back then.

Correctly or not, up until that point, LeBron was perceived as disappearing under high pressure, and losing this game would pretty much ratchet up the hate machine.

He said before the game that he would play all game and came out on a mission. Was just ridiculous how he dominated that game, made all the difficult shots, off balance, long 3, and everything in between, absolutely unguardable.",NA,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uzerky/jimmy_butlers_seasonsaving_game_6_performance/,-0.936,0.044,0.816,0.139

2022-05-28,narmerguy,"If you are going to compare it to a specific game (Lebron Game 6 2012 vs Boston) a typical person expects that what makes them comparable is the very thing that makes the well-known game special. What made that game special was the context coupled with the dominant performance. It was the dominance in spite of all the history and narratives and expectations. 

Boston for the Lebron game wasn't just some opponent located in the city of Boston, it was _the_ team that had beaten him so many times that it forced him to upend the entire NBA by joining forces with Wade and Bosh. It was a team that mocked him and had already won a championship. Boston means nothing to Jimmy, and to be honest today's Boston means frankly nothing to anyone except maybe Kyrie. They are a young team that has proven nothing and won nothing. So when you say the games are comparable because they both faced ""Boston"" in a game 6 elimination, they're not really facing the same ""Boston"" at all. None of the players, none of the coaches, not even the same GM. Just the jerseys. 

If the Raptors had ever come back from behind to beat the Lebron Cavaliers on the strength of a transcendent 40-point performance from Lowry or Derozan, that would have been more comparable to Lebron's 2012 Game 6 than what Jimmy did tonight. 

I'm not trying to say you can't find similarities between Jimmy's Game 6 scenario and Lebron's. I'm saying those similarities are so inconsequential to what made Lebron's game iconic that they trivialize the context that made 2012 ECF Game 6 a memorable NBA reference point in the first place.",NA,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uzerky/jimmy_butlers_seasonsaving_game_6_performance/,0.886,0.081,0.872,0.046

In fact you could argue Butler's overall stats are better with 8 assists to 1 turnover vs LeBron's 5 assists to 4 turnover. Butler also did this with an injured knee which no one is bringing up.

>The two sides met at the Hamptons on New York's Long Island. **To convince Durant**, four Warriors stars attended the meeting: Stephen Curry, **Draymond Green**, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala.

Now he's denying it all.  Receipts.

EDIT: and more:

>And he didn‚Äôt stop there. The ESPN.com report indicates Green‚Äôs next call was to KD. It‚Äôs unclear what Green said to him‚Äîhe didn‚Äôt elaborate while speaking with ESPN.com‚Äôs Zach Lowe‚Äîbut he clearly wasted no time trying to convince KD to come to Golden State. He didn't even pull out of the Oracle Arena parking lot before doing it. ""That was my very next call,"" Green said, before talking about how he now sees the Warriors losing the 2016 NBA Finals as a blessing in disguise. ""If we win the championship, I‚Äôm like 99 percent sure we don‚Äôt get him. There are silver linings to everything.""

>This isn‚Äôt the first time Green has admitted to essentially begging KD to join the Warriors. During an interview with DraftKings last July, he revealed that he sent ""too many text messages"" to him during the recruitment process. But back then, he denied trying to recruit KD before NBA free agency opened up. So many NBA fans are now wondering if what Green did after Game 7 would constitute as tampering, which is something that‚Äôs not allowed in the NBA.
