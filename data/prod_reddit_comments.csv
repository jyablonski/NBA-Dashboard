[Look at Caruso](https://twitter.com/StephNoh/status/1485004818460692482) out there hustling with a fractured\* wrist, even when guarding Giannis. The guy gives 100% no matter what.

2022-01-23,SevenHunnet3Hi5s,"here's my stance: i feel like it was definitely on purpose. but grayson probably had no idea how severe it was going to be. this is the biggest injury that i've seen him cause at least in the nba. he's 100% being reckless on purpose. but not necessarily trying to injure players on purpose even though that's obviously a huge effect of being reckless. he's aware of that

in his mind hes probably okay with hurting players a bit, just not on this kinda level. his reputation is what makes it so bad for him because instead of ""oh i didn't mean to hurt him in any kind of way"" it's more like ""oh i didn't mean to hurt him this badly."" and obviously intentionally harming players to any degree is unacceptable.

>!he had it coming. he always knew he could cause an injury. it's just that he never actually thought it would happen. he got too comfortable and his brain became wired to think playing recklessly would be fine because the worst that's happened was probably not anything like this.!<

2022-01-23,240to180,"CHICAGO, IL --  It's been a rocky start for Bulls legend Dennis Rodman, who returned to the NBA yesterday on a 10 day contract with his former team. In his first league appearance in 21 years, the rebounding phenom was ejected just seven seconds into regulation.

Rodman, once the villain of professional basketball, seemed uninterested in changing that legacy yesterday, when he ran full speed at Milwaukee Bucks shooting guard Grayson Allen, picking the 26-year old up above his head and body-slamming him into the side of the announcers table. Allen was airlifted to a hospital over an hour away in Milwaukee, after multiple hospitals in the Chicago area were unable to provide him service due to  ""administrative errors"". His condition is stable.

The incident has led many to speculate on what the future holds for Rodman, who may opt to retire from play rather than serve any punishment from the league. When signed, many speculated that the Bulls legend's time in basketball was long over. Rodman, who turned 60 this year, was immediately made the league's second-oldest active player when signing his deal, after Udonis Haslem, who turned 82 in May.",Knicks,258,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/sac270/bucks_good_morning_video_of_allen_eating_a_donut/,-0.128,0.037,0.929,0.034

To be fair, they do have a lot of random posts like this for a variety of players, so it’s possible this was just sent out on a schedule and not actually meant to make fun of the Caruso situation. But man someone’s gotta realize that would be controversial.

2022-01-23,TheFakeTimShady,"Teacher here, schools are legally bound to provide specialized services to special education students. This can be as simple as students receiving adapted test materials to specialized classroom settings for students who can't meet expectations in a gen Ed classroom.

A legitimate audit of special education services would create the biggest scandal and crisis public education has ever seen. In my state, I would ballpark it and say that probably 80% of schools are out of compliance in some form or fashion. The fact that this school ""didn't have a backup plan"" when one teacher is out tells me that are ridiculously understaffed to accommodate diverse learners. This is obviously the most common infraction but I've known schools that ""misplace"" IEPs and put special Ed students in gen Ed classes and hope the parents don't know any better.

I say all this to comment that there not being a ""backup plan"" for this student when his teacher wasn't present is very likely even worse than that. If a student's IEP stipulates that they attend a self-contained class (specialized class outside of gen Ed with a qualified teacher) it is quite literally illegal to put them in a Gen Ed room. The fact that this was even considered a solution by decision makers shows how little respect special education accommodations are given. Having this student sit in a principal's office and watch YouTube all day would have been an infinitely better idea. This is certainly not the first time this has happened at this school and it also happens at schools everywhere, all the time.

2022-01-23,Pandamonium98,"Yeah people always say “pick BPA” in hindsight as if we all knew who the BPA was before the draft. 

And it’s not an ironclad rule. A lot of players need to play games and get minutes to develop, and if you have a logjam at center like the Sixers did with Okafor, Embiid, and Noel, your guys can’t develop or they can develop but then you need to trade them away for a big discount eventually since they didn’t have the chance to prove their value. 

People seem to really underrate how important situational factors are for players. Guys like LeBron and KD were going to be stars regardless of where they ended up, but most lottery picks aren’t like that. 

Teams like the Spurs and Raptors and Heat do a good job of picking talent, but they also develop talent even when guys flamed out elsewhere or were just bouncing around the G league. You shouldn’t pass on a clearly better prospect just for positional reasons (especially as a lottery team), but when the draft order is less clear and there’s a lot of uncertainty, you should still take into account the opportunities that different players will have and whether the team will be able to develop them effectively

And fit with a team matters too. There are a lot of centers out there that are better overall than Kevon Lonney, but Looney has fit the Warriors system so well that they’re not going to replace him with a guy that’s slightly better but a worse fit. In a vacuum, D’Lo would get picked above Wiggins if it were solely about BPA, but the warriors are better with Wiggins even if you ignore the draft compensation they received.

2022-01-23,IGotTheTech,"Exactly.

People got to remember for 2-3 years Green was the best player or at least top 3 in FIBA competition (was MVP of the tournament in 2018). Mobley, Cade, Suggs, Barnes, and Haliburton were each on those teams for at least a year as well. That's why all the ""no college"" talk is funny because dude destroyed FIBA every year.

Additionally, he was one of the youngest players every single one of those tournaments. In fact he played the u16, u17, skipped the u18 tournament to play in the u19 tournament probably to keep with his same class instead of his group's age.

So considering his age, Green is not a fit pick and still isn't - it's always been a long term play with the hope he has some short term success and foundation/experience (which is why fewer minutes is kinda counterproductive). Green wasn't some G-League star that played into an NBA draft. Dude was highly recognized amongst all those peers as a top dog before he decided to go to the G-League to make money and be a trailblazer.

2022-01-23,faithfuljohn,"> but I still think it was a basketball play

going up is a basketball play. Fouling a person in the act of attempting to score is a basketball play. Pulling on him after the contact while said player is in mid-air may or may be a ""basketball play"" (I say no), but it is very very dangerous. Players who are in mid-air are vunerable. And doing things like that is exceptionally dangerous. 

There is a reason why sometimes players attempt to even catch opponents who are in mid-air. Cause some things are more important than the two points that are being attempted.  

Here's an example of Steven Adams trying to help Plumlee instead of going for the and-1 (2 or 3 plays). You can argue that if Adams had trying to keep going it would have been a basketball (and they would be right). But Adams understood something that Allen clearly doesn't. You try not to hurt players. They are your coworkers.

I understand it's kind of a neckbeard take but it's true that American education was a disaster before COVID. 

In my 2019 school year for grades 6-12 we had roughly 100 students with IEPs. We had one case worker for all of them. That meant one person to keep track of accommodations, maintain goals, communicate with families, write IEPs, etc. Oh and she was plucked out of Teach for America with zero experience.

Younger students respect their classmates much more, and especially those are disabled. This is why inclusion is so important in the early years. The exposure for general Ed students to special needs students has the potential to change their whole outlook which can eliminate interactions like the one in the video.

2022-01-23,TheEliteCalhoun,"I think Reddit gets called emotional because it is, in general.  More specifically, there were people lashing out about Giannis earlier as if he somehow did something wrong.  That’s child like emotions playing out.

That being said another reason this incident really struck a chord is because Caruso comes off as a guy that works as hard as he can to be the best player that he can.  The league and fans love hustle players, myself included and Caruso is indeed that.  It is easy to love Caruso’s game.

Greyson Allen is like that shitty kid that always had a season ski pass but used it like once a year.  His mom always assured him of how smart and great he was and at his high school he was probably considered a beast athlete.  As he was exposed to more of the world he realized he wasn’t MJ and started to incorporate dirty plays.  Let me tell you what dirty player is a euphemism for - cheater.  In spirit, his ass is a cheater.  Hell even if Caruso would have charged him two plays earlier or something it would be easier to understand.  This is just a kid stomping their feet and saying “DADDY I WANT A GOLDEN TICKET!!”  It’s easy to hate that game so much you actually start to dislike the person.

2022-01-23,IGotTheTech,"Cade only played one of those years.

Green, Mobley, Suggs and Barnes played in a few of them.

That's pretty much why all those guys seem close with Green during the draft. I actually think Suggs, Barnes and Green are pretty close off the court. Which is funny because the fans think all these rookies only have blood out for each other.

If you want to see some blowouts, those FIBA highlights were crazy. I think one of the years they nearly gave one country a 100-piece blowout.

Edit:  
It was Croatia who they beat by 74:

2022-01-23,clancydog4,"Nah, this wouldn't work at all simply because there really isn't a strong correlation between how dirty or dangerous a foul is and the injury that occurs.

There are some HORRIBLY dirty and dangerous fouls that resulted in zero serious injury and no games missed.  For example, Barea missed zero games from this but it's one of the most dangerous and dirty plays I've ever seen:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIWSKssJP2E&ab_channel=KevinManning

Thankfully the NBA suspended Bynum several games for it, but Barea didn't miss any.

Whereas ya look at the play where Danny Green fouled Klay in the air, widely considered a fair play, but Klay tore his ACL -- *had* they called that a flagrant 2 instead of 1, you think Danny should have had to sit for the entire next season??

It sounds fair, but it doesn't work at all because the flagrant or dangerous nature of the foul doesn't have a strong enough correlation to the injury.  Grayson being suspended literally 30-40 games wouldn't make much sense if a player who did the exact same thing but the other player *didn't* break their wrist wouldnt be suspended at all. 

It sounds ""fair"" on paper, but it really isn't practical and would lead to a lot more ""unfair"" situations where players can do super dirty shit but with massively different punishments for the same level of dirty shit.

If Danny Green got hurt trying to block Klay's dunk, it'd look pretty fucking stupid for Raptors fans to blame Klay.

Also you guys still bitch about Mike Dunleavy, get over yourself, you guys are clearly no different from any other fanbase and if Blake Griffin hurt Jrue the same way Giannis did Kyrie you guys would cry and bitch about it until there was no more cheese in Wisconsin.

Garbage ass Bucks fan. I don't think Giannis is dirty nor do I ever expect Bucks fan to acknowledge how devastating that play was.

2022-01-23,Sullan08,"I see that angle for sure, but on the flip side, the internet has opened avenues for the ""outcasts"" to find relief as well. Whether it be venting about the bullying, or just finding a space to enjoy your interests with other like minded people. It's not like pre/early-internet where if you were ""weird"", many times you just experienced it alone or with a couple friends at most. 

I think the internet is kind of a net positive in that regard.

Bullying will always be an issue, but it's way less common these days to be bullied for being gay, for example. I'd say for having mental issues as well, although this post obviously reflects opposite of that. This change is most prominent in high school it seems though when people mature more. Middle schoolers really are little sociopaths running around lol.

I will say in general I can't really relate to being bullied though nor did it really happen in my schools outside of minor incidents. If anything I was the bully in early elementary (nothing egregious, just a couple dumb kid moments).

The way I have seen general Ed teachers act towards SPED students is just embarrassing. We need to stick up for our students, disabilities or not. It is not a hard concept for me; unfortunately, this is not true for teachers as a whole.

We need to provide for our students and I will do that to the death of me. It makes me happy I am in a position to do so. I have seen districts take so much advantage of parents who have little to no knowledge of inclusion and end up segregating their children from their true possibilities.

In the end, every state is different and every district is different. I dream for the day of the education reform, because it is just pathetic right now (talking USA as a whole).

2022-01-23,Mtbnz,"> There's a scale in terms of how dirty

Yeah, I said that in my first sentence. But two plays are very rarely the exact same, and they don't need to be in order to be comparable.

Imo, the biggest difference between the two plays is the outcome, not the intent or the actions themselves.

Harden makes absolutely no attempt to play the ball, and while he may have been trying to simply commit a touch foul to prevent an easy bucket, those fouls can easily be incredibly dangerous if they cause a player to slip on the rim and fall. This Harden play is more severe than Amare's foul on Bogut that caused him to dislocate his elbow and almost ended his career.

Just because Giannis didn't fall doesn't mean that Harden's foul was dirty or dangerous. I don't think either Allen OR Harden intended to hurt their opponents, but both of them made reckless, dangerous plays without concern for their opponent's safety which could easily cause harm. It's pure luck that one of them did and one of them didn't.",NA,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/sah0vj/highlight_greg_anthony_on_grayson_allen_theres_no/,-0.8125,0.166,0.662,0.172

2022-01-23,skrulewi,"i just had a memory of having a special needs kid in my class in the 3rd grade all year. must have been 1995. never did happen again and when it was happening i didn't really notice it. he was in a wheelchair and was pretty limited so in my 3rd-grade mind i was never really thinking about it.

but i had no problem with him there, and neither did anyone else in our class. i'm sure our teacher had us practice in little ways how to be polite and just be accepting and accommodating. i think it did affect my attitude over the years towards special needs people. it gave me that experience being near people that were different when i had no experience before.

and nowadays i watch SBSK videos and i wonder what sort of experiences that young man must have had in his life, and hope that he had an OK experience in our classroom back then.",TrailBlazers,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/sa8p2z/joe_ingles_trae_young_condemn_the_physical_attack/,0.9001,0.126,0.812,0.062

On a real it's scary how fickle a fan base can be if your drafted player is *underperforming*. That's only in comparison to another player that was drafted before or even after you. 

Trae and Luka had some harsh criticisms for Trae early, I'm happy it worked out for both parties but even our boy, Scottie Barnes.

2022-01-23,8BallTiger,"> public education is absolutely socialism, providing services for children in exchange for tax dollars

That is not socialism. The Massachusetts Bay Colony was not socialist when they opened a public school in the 17th century. The government doing stuff (aka using your tax dollars) is not socialist! This line of thinking can lead me to say “tax payers paying for B-2 stealth bombers is socialism.” Was George Bush a socialist for expanding Medicare?  Is Texas a socialist state because they have a tax payer funded department of education and department of transportation? That’s not socialism! Socialism is literally democratic control over the means of production and the products over that production.

2022-01-23,Go_Mets,"Inclusion done right is when the students don’t even realize it’s happening. It is supposed to be natural and if the teacher doesn’t act like it’s a big deal, students won’t either. 

I’m glad you had such an accepting teacher so early on. What you just said is a great example of how successful inclusion can impact students for years to come. 

It is not a big deal that there is a student in your class who looks or learns differently from other students and it is becoming more and more common.

Assuming that student did well in class, just imagine if he was forced to be in a special education classroom just because he was in a wheelchair.

It also can lead to massive problems in the classroom because these teachers are getting children in their classes that they are just straight up not ready for. The newer teachers are a lot more open to mainstreaming because they have learned a lot more about inclusive practices through their schooling. On the other hand, older teachers look at it more as a burden to their classrooms more than anything else.

It’s just a such a fine line right now, but as more teachers retire I think it will benefit inclusive practices as a whole because more teachers will be equipped with the knowledge needed to successfully mainstream students.

But like you said, we shouldn’t be mainstreaming children just to do it - what is best for that certain child in the end is what should matter most.",NA,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/sa8p2z/joe_ingles_trae_young_condemn_the_physical_attack/,0.9691,0.163,0.805,0.032

I get sticking up for your team and guys, but this is stupid. Allen has a history, and even if this is his first flagrant in the league, it still shows a wanton disregard for players safety and his reaction show how much he hasn't grown up.

And I watched that game, my perception was that he was reacting to the crowd's boos and jeers, but this is all speculation on our part.

I watched the previous game against the grizzlies where he ignored the live ball and an opportunity to give the bucks possession, because he was more concerned with checking on Ja after he unintentionally fouled him. I'm no die hard stan of Grayson or anything but I'd rather judge a man on his actions today than what he did when he was 18-21 years old, and over the past couple seasons he certainly hasn't been as egregious as some people are making him out to be so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.

Grizzlies bubble clip: That's not even dirty... He misses the ball, stumbles, falls, and gets unlucky when Jrue falls on him. Actually, the main way you can tell this isn't dirty is that he immediately checks on Jrue, he usually doesn't do that when he does an actual dirty play.

Bucks/Bulls clip: The dirty play we are talking about.

I recall that he had a lot of jerking movements with his limbs, and couldn't really speak, but I honestly have no idea what his level of intellectual functioning was; if he just physically couldn't speak or if he didn't understand anything.

There were two bulls players already responding to Caruso, and he relaxes his ""oh that was bad"" (or whatever you would label that posture) after the ref touches him on the back to pass him on the way to Caruso.

I don't think it's unreasonable to assume he realized the bulls players wouldn't have been receptive to him approaching in that moment, even if it was to apologize.

What's unreasonable is using his lack of apology as proof of his malicious intent.

2022-01-23,revisioncloud,"These are midranges (which he also rarely takes these days) but they look smoother [here](https://youtu.be/W7Zy8NHselU). Not as smooth as pure shooters like Klay of course

Even his stepbacks, he doesn't flail his legs out, it has better follow through, and the release is more consistent. This season I feel like the release timing is a bit off, there's less arc, and his body becomes out of line so it looks more like he chucks it to the rim. We attribute it to being defended so closely which is mostly true but also, I see him do this type of shot even when he doesn't need to

All in all, I feel like like he's making the shot more difficult for himself than it should be

Edit: Compare that [here](https://youtu.be/0G1xI5N7trE) even if it went in. And the Pels clutch shot was even x10 worse in terms of form, it was almost a lucky shot. I feel like this season he purposely added a stepback/ sidestep with a longer step and longer fade (line of body angled away from the rim) which imo is almost a new type of (go-to) shot that doesn't work whereas before, when steps back he can still keep his body more straight and the release is more consistent",Thunder,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/saihq4/highlight_sga_breaks_darius_garlands_ankles_and/,0.9757,0.143,0.823,0.034

It is no coincidence the Bucks play the Kings Tonight:

4. Grayson Allen and the Two Bears (2 Kings 2:23-25)


Then he went up from there to Alex; and as he was going up by the way, young lads came out from the city and mocked him and said to him, “Go up, you baldhead; go up, you baldhead!” 24 When he looked behind him and saw them, he cursed them in the name of the Lord and pulled Alex down. Then two female bears(Memphis grizzlies) came out of the woods and tore up forty-two lads of their number(the bucks, and thier g league team). 25 And he went from there to Mount Carmel(Denver nuggets on a road trip), and from there he returned to Samaria.


The Bucks are destined to lose to the Memphis Grizzlies in the Finals, due to injuries. Those injuries will devastate both the Bucks, and the Hurd.

If the Lakers were to go 10-2 over their last 12 games before the all star break and the Jazz were to continue their recent play (4-6 in their last 10) and go say 5-7 in their 12 games before the all star break, then the Jazz would be at 35-23 and the Lakers would be 33-25. Btw, if you look at who the Jazz are playing in their next 12 games, this happening is absolutely possible.

Again, totally hypothetical, but the whole point of my statement was just to denounce this foolish idea that the poster I was replying too was trying to portray. This hypothetical put them just 2 games out of 4th and its only considering their next 12 games, they still have a whole other 24 games after that to continue making headway. 

IMO the only team that is *actually* clear of the Lakers (and the rest of the teams in the 5-9 seeds in the West) is Phoenix. Warriors, Grizzlies, and Jazz all still have to continue playing their high level basketball in order to maintain their seeding come seasons end.

2. Talen Horton-Tucker (~25MPG)
3. Rajon Rondo (~15MPG on Lakers [pre-trade])
4. Wayne Ellington (~20MPG)
5. Kendrick Nunn (still out)

In the 30 games that Carmelo Anthony played before the Anthony Davis injury, he averaged 13.2 PPG on 40% from 3 and 43% from the field in 28 MPG. 

It is so important to have bench depth, and it's absolutely critical when your best player and most important player is 37yo LeBron James. Having bench depth lets you try different lineups and offensive/defensive schemes, and it makes each game overall easier for each player on the team when the team is overall more difficult to guard because their is more players to gameplan for and more offensive weapons.

The Lakers had a really difficult start to the season and they are *very* lucky that their schedule was so significantly backend heavy in terms of when they play the most talented teams.

2022-01-23,jlluh,"Language barrier aside, I completely agree with Giannis. I like how he phrased it even.

You see it all the time on TV. Some young person has done an impressive thing, and people line up to tell them how amazing and awesome they are. A few years later, they've got drug issues, and the very same TV hosts who were sucking their dicks are 'shocked' that they stopped being well-grounded.

On an athlete level, I remember an interview Roger Federer gave when he was undisputed world number 1. He talked about how at his level, improvement was hard because he's already so good, and his training was mostly about maintaining his skill.

If, instead of having that mindset, he had been training hungrily to improve his weaknesses, he'd probably be the GOAT like everyone thought he would be.

2022-01-23,sportsinaround,"One time I was hanging out at the YMCA where they were hosting my little bro's youth basketball camp. I was drinking from the water fountain and suddenly I notice someone put their finger in-front of the faucet causing water to splash all over me -- you know, like the bullies did in school. I looked up and thought it was Ted Cruz at first, but after a moment realized it was Grayson Allen. In shock, we locked eyes and with a smirk he said ""What? It's just water.""  He kept on down the hall toward the gym entrance and right before he swung the door open way harder than he needed to, I saw him slap a kid's Harry Potter book out of his hands while yelling ""See ya later dweeb!"". I couldn't believe it. I had enough and went to go confront him due to this unacceptable behavior, but once he entered the gym all the kids got excited and started surrounding him like he was their savior -- ""It's Grayson Allen!!!!"". He brought out all of the PR quotes -- ""Hey little man, I saw that play you made, it was dope!"", ""Keep it up, one day you'll be taking my spot!"" As this was happening, I saw my mom go over with my lil bro to ask him for an autograph. Grayson goes ""Sure thing and I wouldn't mind signing THIS later too!"" while simultaneously grabbing my mom's butt and giving me a wink from across the gym.

The first hit was a hard foul, whiffing on the ball and getting all forearm. 

Allen didn't pull him down like many are suggesting. He never grasps the arm.

Allen's second swing was still somewhat going for the ball to prevent an and-1.

It was a reckless and hard foul that would've just been that 95% of the time. This was the 5% that went very bad, and ended in an injury.

Allen committed manslaughter, not first degree murder. Still bad, but not psychopathic.

2022-01-23,itshurleytime,"Watch it again. Caruso has a fair amount of control on the ball he is still trying to put up until a slow-mo frame or two before his left arm gets hit with Grayson's right. The contact from the second hand hitting him isn't even what caused Caruso to go down so awkwardly.

Instead, Grayson is turning his body mid-air to try to get the stop with his right arm, and yanks on Caruso with his left to be able to turn his body in that direction. That yank is what pulled Caruso down, not the slap on Caruso's right arm with his left.

I know he doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt, but think of how quickly you have to think about your action (of turning your body to try to stop an and-1 situation).

It's unfortunate and Grayson is going to get what he deserves, but I find it incredibly hard to think that he just saw an opportunity to injure someone so he took it.

Based on what? Their two biggest free agents in recent memory are Shaq and LeBron. That’s a 20 year gap between those guys. They don’t get FAs like people pretend they do. Kawhi just chose the fucking Clippers over the Lakers a couple years ago. That wouldn’t have happened in any reality back in the 80s. Things are very different now. Other teams have more money (a lot more money in the Clippers case). Other markets are just as alluring (NY/BKN, MIA). The main thing the Lakers have is the franchise history.

* Curry has been struggling for almost 2 months now
* Klay isn't even close to up to speed yet and is still on a minutes restriction 
* Draymond is out until *at least* the end of January (which is 5 more games)
* The team is still struggling to even beat teams that are tanking like Houston, Indiana, New Orleans, etc
* In their games until the all star break they have to play: Utah (x2), Dallas, Minnesota, Brooklyn, Lakers, Clippers, Nuggets. That's 8 of their remaining 13 games before the all star break

That's not what happened...

Also Giannis's injury was BECAUSE of Giannis. He went up to block the Capela alley-oop, and the only place for Capela to land was unfortunately Giannis's knee. If Danny Green got hurt trying to block Klay's dunk, it'd look pretty fucking stupid for Raptors fans to blame Klay.

2022-01-23,joodo123,Actually that was pretty clearly an intentional foul. Sure he didn’t mean to hurt him. His intent in the action was to prevent the shot with a foul. Regardless of his desired outcome he intended the action. As a result of his intended foul Caruso was injured. So yeah long way to say it was intentional and he’s responsible for injuring another player.

2022-01-23,Untchj,"People saying Russ ain’t listening lol As bad as he’s been, man Russ don’t need to listen to Shaq. Shaq is a critical analyst now and he needs to own that. I say ‘critical’ bc, Greg Anthony doesn’t single out guys. Steve smith doesn’t single out guys. Dennis smith doesn’t. Shaq tho is in a specific lane of bball analysts. And once you cross over into that lane you’re a critic. So don’t do that gaslighting nonsense where you try to cover it up as ‘motivating’ a player. You’re a critic. Own it. Shaq tried it with Donovan Mitchell and it was BS. Kendrick Perkins just did it with jayson Tatum and it was BS

It comes down to a principle that isn’t even exclusive to sports: **praise in public, criticize in private**. Once you publicly criticize a player past a normal level , you can NEVER expect that player to genuinely take your advice. No matter how much we/you think the advice is needed. 

Now if you have an existing relationship that can be different. But mostly that’s not the case. These ex players are speaking on these players—-as they should, make your money!—-but then wanna fall back on ‘I’m the OG show me respect’. Nah you chose a profession and there are sacrifices.

2022-01-23,AdolescentThug,"Not The guy you’re commenting on, but I have a couple gripes about his game. Giannis is known to be a little dirty on the offensive end, likes to throw that elbow out a little too much tbh. Also he’s solved it recently, but he used to have 0 bag in a half court set. When he couldn’t get through a guy and the shot clock was winding down, he used to always just take the ball back to half court and just run downhill into you. It was REALLY predictable lol, last time I remember seeing it was against the Nets last playoffs. Feels like he plugged that hole in his game this past offseason though, he doesn’t hesitate on going to the mid range or 3, and looks like he actually has enough variety with moves to mix it up when the game slows down. 

Absolutely 0 issues with him as a person though, he’s a really jolly guy who’s stoked him and his family made it through and simply wants to get better.
