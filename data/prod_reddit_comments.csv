2022-05-28,narmerguy,"With all due respect, no one who watched the NBA at that time would say these games are comparable. That Lebron game was the culmination of so many storylines being squashed and demons being exorcised, and facing a team that had a known championship core as well. 

The weight of that game, if the heat lost it, probably that team was going to get blown up. Everyone thought this was going to be yet another playoff loss for the supposed best player in the league and instead he delivered one of the greatest and eeriest playoff performances of all time. People often don't remember that he did not sub out a single minute of that game until the last 3 minutes when Boston was so thoroughly demolished that it was basically garbage time. I've never seen a game like that from Lebron, and the look in his eyes is basically iconic now.

Then they went and added maybe the greatest scorer in the history of the game (1 of 2 players in the league who could give them competition and added him to their team)— where somehow he was literally a perfect fit for the role and roster.

I think back to that video of a crypto guy explaining yield farming, and gets called out by bankers because it’s literally a Ponzi scheme. Take that same conversation in a room with athletes, and it runs different. “You guys get X amount of coins with a cash incentive, if you promote it, the crypto increases in value and you’ll make a ton of money.”  It’s not hard to see how they end up getting involved. It’s a shame because they become the face of it while the others ride into the sunset. 

I know De’Aron Fox promoted some shitcoin, but I couldn’t tell you the scumbag who created it and scammed all of those people out of their money. Don’t get me wrong, shame on Fox, but way more heads need to roll for that.

Tobias Harris over me…. I’ll take Tobias tbh. Jimmy isn’t what he was in the bubble anymore. He a subpar scorer that can get locked up by good defenders.

2022-05-28,jio_tenchuu,"Bill Simmons was at the game. Here's how he described it:

>I don’t know what happened. I just know the shots wouldn’t stop going in. After about the fifth dagger in a row (he made 10 straight), the crowd started groaning on every make — shades of Philly’s Andrew Toney ripping our hearts out 30 years ago. If you’ve ever been in the building for one of those games, you know there isn’t a deadlier sound. He single-handedly murdered one of the giddiest Celtics crowds I can remember. Thirty points in the first half. Thirty! All with that blank look on his face. It was like watching surveillance video of a serial killer coldly dismembering a body and sticking the parts in the fridge. Only we were right there.  
>  
>You can’t imagine what this was like to witness in person. I know Michael Jordan had similarly astonishing games, and others, too, but not with stakes like that. This wasn’t just an elimination game. This was LeBron James’s entire career being put on trial … and it only took an hour for him to tell the jury, “Go home. I’m one of the best players ever. Stop picking me apart. Stop talking about the things I can’t do. Stop holding me to standards that have never been applied to any other NBA player. Stop blaming me for an admittedly dumb decision I never should have made. Stop saying I’m weak. Stop saying that I don’t want to win. Stop. Just … stop.”  
>  
>As a Celtics fan, I was devastated. As a basketball fan, I appreciated the performance for what it was. One of the greatest players ever was playing one of his greatest games ever. He swallowed up every other relevant story line. Needless to say, the Celtics couldn’t match him — especially Pierce, who’s worn down from four weeks of battling Andre Iguodala, Shane Battier and LeBron on one leg and appears to be running on fumes of his fumes’ fumes at this point. The fans were so shell-shocked that many (including me and my father) filed out with three minutes remaining, not because we were lousy fans, not to beat the traffic, but because we didn’t want to be there anymore. We wanted to get away from LeBron. He ruined what should have been a magical night. We never really had a chance to cheer, swing the game, rally our guys, anything. He pointed a remote control at us and pressed “MUTE.” It was like being in a car accident.

If Draymond had such a problem with that maybe he should’ve handled it in the locker room. Calling someone a bitch because they got on you for your mistake is just an overly emotional response. I don’t know why you don’t apply that same standard to Dray as you do KD as far dealing with it behind closed doors.

2022-05-28,jeffthenarwhal666,"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  
  
I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  
  
I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  
  
and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  
  
I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  
  
he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  
  
and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  
  
I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  
  
until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  
  
edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass.",Warriors,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uzeqr5/post_game_thread_the_miami_heat_33_force_a_game_7/,0.9498,0.085,0.862,0.053

Although I joked in the game thread that Dray's reverse Psychology worked, I'd believe what he said about not letting the media noise get into him. There were questionable calls on both sides and I didn't see it affect him that much while the rest of the players were losing their minds. I wasn't able to follow their games but from watching this game alone, I believe he was telling the truth. 

The opposite of what I noticed with Luka when the other team is playing great. You can tell it affects his game. I left a comment on the game thread yesterday how important it was for Steve Kerr to tell the team to not let the great shots of the Mavs affect their game in the first half. Although it was more for the younger guys because I'd like to believe the vets have psyched themselves for that. Also why it's frustrating to watch Draymond complain or overreact because he should know better than possibly get ejected.

None of the tweets excerpted in the lawsuit mentioned a business relationship with the token’s creators. Shortly after promoting the project, the lawsuit claimed, Mr. Pierce sold his tokens — an apparent “pump and dump” operation in which he profited by encouraging fans to buy the tokens, before selling his own holdings at a higher price.

Athletes are scamming their fans, and fans are still bending over backward to defend their favorite players. Just shows how much fans will build up their favorite star onto such a high pedestal that they will look the other way no matter what they do.

2022-05-28,kneeco28,"If you had home advantage in a best-of-7 and could decide which 4 games to (potentially) host, which would you choose?

You have to choose before the series and can't change midstream.

When I have asked this question to people, they always include game 7, but I think that's a mistake. Game 7s don't happen all that often and game 6, which happens way more often, is necessarily a 3-2 potential close-out affair.

So I am tempted to forego game 7. Also, I never want to be at a point in the series where there's been more away games than home, so I'm definitely taking game 1.

Finally, I don't think you want to ever have a situation of playing three straight on the road in a best of seven, so I don't think you can take 1-4, even though it's the only way to guarantee you get all your home games and gives you a chance to win without travel.

I think 1, 2, 4, 5 makes a lot of sense and maybe is the mathematically correct answer (especially if we're considering a subsequent round benefit of shorter earlier rounds). But I just can't get over the possibility of going on the road for both 6 and 7. 

So I think my answer is 1, 2, 4, 6. You get that crucial potential game 6, always have more games on your court then theirs, and never give them even the potential for back to back home games.

The constant travel might increase variance though, which you don't want as the home advantage team.",Raptors,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uyxp10/daily_discussion_thread_game_thread_index/,0.984,0.131,0.843,0.026

There was a time he called bosh over for a screen and didn't even look at him just waved him over. Like it's seriously nothing i've ever seen before not just from him but any player.

> Matt (27:13): I think of myself as like a fairly cynical person. And that was so much more cynical than how I would've described farming. You're just like, well, I'm in the Ponzi business and it's pretty good.

> Joe Weisenthal (27:27): At no point did any of this require any sort of like economic case, it’s just like other people put money in the box. And so I'm going to too, and then it's more valuable. So they're gonna put more money in, and at no point in the cycle, did it seem to like, describe any sort of like economic purpose?

> SBF (27:42): So on the one hand, I think that’s a pretty reasonable response, but let me play around with this a little bit. Because that's one framing of this. And I think there's like a sort of depressing amount of validity…

Looks like a shell of himself physically.
Knew when he looked up at the rim like you look at a ref when you dont get a call after his 2nd airball it was over

Jimmy isn’t a superstar

It's insane how Jimmy successfully brainwashed people into thinking he's some clutch god that carried his team to the Finals in 2020 (absolutely not true even though he was great in the Finals)

Said it before and I'll say it again. He isn't a superstar.

Tobias Harris over me…. I’ll take Tobias tbh. Jimmy isn’t what he was in the bubble anymore. He a subpar scorer that can get locked up by good defenders. 

Tbh I don't think he's a playoff superstar as the media says he is. He's a really good player but short of the superstar you need especially when his co stars are not producing. He can’t carry a team like other players.

Kawhi became a top tier in 2017. 2017-2022 is 6 years. Through these six years since he’s been a top tier:

Kawhi has had 2 healthy seasons. 1 of which he had a fantastic, ATG level run and won the title (2019). The best we’ve seen dude for a full run. The other season saw him flame out when he and his team committed one of the biggest chokejobs in NBA history and blew a 3-1 lead to Denver (2020).

He was shaping up to have great runs in 2017 and 2021 but got injured in both and because of said injuries, he missed the 2018 and 2022 seasons pretty much entirely.

Could he leave? Sure.

Any 3-1 finals chokejob will be compared to the 2016 finals. 

Any 20+ missed 3s will be compared to the Rockets 27 missed 3s. 

You don't need many things to be exactly the same for 2 things to be comparable. You're completely missing the point. By your logic, nothing in this world is comparable.  Dirk had fever, MJ had flu. Dirk played for Mavs against the heat, MJ played for the Bulls against the Jazz. MJ is the GOAT and Dirk isn't. Dirk is a PF, MJ is a SG. Dirk is European, MJ is an American. One is in 97 and one is on 2011. So are those 2 games not comparable?

Edit: If you're so horny to insist that context matters for 2 things to be comparable, then using your example, how does Lowry or Derozan compare to Lebron? Lebron got hyped up since he was high school. Lebron is the face of this generation. Lebron choked in the previous finals. Lebron left his hometown team to create a ""super team"". No one really gives 2 shits about Lowry or Derozan. One is a generational talent who has a career defining legacy game while Lowry/Derozan are just all stars. I don't know why you're choosing specific things to insist that they have to be the same for 2 things to be comparable while neglecting so many other things.

Give me one wish, and it'll be Sixers fans opening their eyes and realizing that everything they complain about from the Raptors that series Embiid was doing the same but multiplied. Bitching about the refs? Embiid seems to not have taken his own advice to Nick Nurse. Siakam doing a rip-through on the euro step? Embiid and Harden both literally do that exact same move regularly, and Embiid elbowed multiple Raptors players in the series, four thrown elbows in just Game 1 alone. Siakam's driving past Tobias Harris which Embiid saw and left Scottie Barnes, who was just at the edge of the logo when Siakam went into his move, to drop down to help on the drive which forced Siakam into going for the euro step in which he brought the ball over (which is a regular basketball move) resulting in Embiid getting hit in the face with the elbow and then putting the ball up for the **incorrectly** called And-One which was then **correctly** overturned to an offensive foul being a frustration foul? Embiid literally dove into Siakam's midsection after Siakam called for a timeout in Game 4 down 12 with 3:06 left in the game, that is an actual frustration foul. Embiid shoving Boucher with his forearm when he was turned facing the other way in a similar manner to Jokic doing to Morris was also a clear frustration and dirty foul.

2022-05-28,twistedmind25,"I agree with 1, 3, 4, 5, but different reasoning. 

I agree with OP about game 7 not being worth it since it rarely happens. 

Going backwards:

5 is guaranteed to either be a series clinching game for one team or put a team on the brink of elimination. Regardless of what side you’re on in those scenarios, want it at home. 

4 is a momentum game. Avoiding or finishing a sweep, you want to be at home. Up 2-1 you want to push a team to the brink, make it hard as possible for them to win. Down 2-1 you don’t want to go to the brink, give yourself all the advantages. 

3 you want because you’re either down 0-2, tied, or up 2-0. Going down 0-3 is a death knell, so being home is better than not. Tied you want at home to increase odds of going up 2-1. Up 2-0 you want at home to go for the jugular and push a team to the brink. 

1 you want because it increases the chances of going up 1-0 in the series. Winning 3 out of 6 is easier than 4 out of 6 after that point, obviously.

6 and 7 you take your chances. Games are so intense I wouldn’t buy into HCA meaning much anyways. Game 2 you take on the road because even worst case you go down 0-2 and you’ve got three in a row at home.",Warriors,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uyxp10/daily_discussion_thread_game_thread_index/,0.9681,0.179,0.753,0.068

2022-05-28,OkAutopilot,"He is extremely competitive, but he has made it very clear that basketball not the most important thing in his life. He's made it clear that winning in Denver, or competing to win, is more important and fulfilling to him than going somewhere else to win. 

Things can change and with any other player I'd take it with a grain of salt, but, I think all Nuggets fans and everyone around the organization feel very differently about those sentiments when Jokic says them. It's abundantly clear how important staying with one franchise is to him, and how unmotivated he is by chasing a legacy. 

In what he says and how he acts it seems very clear that staying in Denver and trying to win with the people here, including some of our staff members who are the closest with Jokic, is more fulfilling to him even if it doesn't result in a championship than going somewhere else just to have a better chance to win. I would bet my life savings on the idea of asking to be traded or forcing a trade would never even cross his mind. Not that any team would have enough assets to entice the FO for trading a B2B MVP in his prime anyway.

Honestly, most teams would be thrilled with Smart taking shots at the others expense.

I think Brown can be gameplanned against. Tatum is the one you cant really stop.

Throw GPII on Brown and Wiggins on Tatum. Give Steph help against Smart and have Draymond cover the C and have him help on Brown.

Horford is the scary one cause he can plug holes but I'm pretty sure Looney can keep up with him. Also, Looney would probably feast on rebounds as thats one of Horfords weaker parts.

2022-05-28,szlive,"Eh, they would have a better chance, but ""probably"" is too generous.

2019 they did have Butler, they lost to Toronto.

2020 would be their best chance, but the bubble was weird, Ben Simmons was out (if they kept Simmons with Butler and discarded Harris / Horford). They would be my pick out of the East, but I wouldn't say they were favorites against the Lakers. Also as far as I can remember, Joel Embiid in 2020 was not the same Joel Embiid as today. Very good player, yes. MVP caliber player, probably not.

2021 they probably would beat the Hawks, but with Embiid playing on an injury and Simmons having his mental issues, I will probably still pick the Bucks in the ECF.

2022-05-28,SkyFoo,"eh, I don't think football is particularly worse than any other light contact sport as a whole, diving and foul baiting problems are either team or singular players problems (getafe and neymar as some of the most known examples) but I remember a match not long ago (maybe Villarreal-Liverpool) where I don't think a single foul was called in like 40 minutes and it was a pretty physical but clean game.

as any other sport it just depends on the ref, the team the player, but I gotta say when the game comes near it's end the non stop clock is an issue as teams sell more fouls and stay on the floor longer.

now I've realized I went on kind of a tangent but addressing that point, I think with football being a more physical sport than basketball say (they allow for more/harder contact) in order to sell fouls you can't just act as if you were pushed too strong as it happens in basketball but as if you got seriously kicked, its annoying but I don't mind as long as the ref isn't buying it or they stop, definitely a worse look though",NBA,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uzcehe/highlight_epic_kyle_lowry_flop_against_horford/,0.443,0.107,0.789,0.103

I genuinely love both of these teams to death. Celtics are my all time number one, the warriors are are number two. 

Every time they play each other in the regular season I feel sick to my stomach, I hate watching my two favorite teams win but obviously a bit more happy when the Celtics win or a bit more unhappy when the Celtics lose. 

I’ve been dreading this since last round that my two teams would be playing each other in the finals and that one side is going to end up incredibly disappointed is very hard and confusing to process because I am such a strong fan of both teams. 

Ride with me Cs till I die but the pleasure is decreased in winning against a team I do also actually love.

2022-05-28,BASEDME7O,"Went down to the piano wire cavs players were strangling curry with off ball while the refs were like “doesn’t look like anything to me”. I’m not a fan of either team but that series convinced me the nba fixes games to extend series. Like the warriors so obviously outclassed them that series should have been warriors in five. You can argue draymond did deserve to be suspended but he was not going to be until lebron asked. And I remember just laughing in game six when they tried to eject Steph as fast as possible, it was just so absurd how they weren’t even trying to hide that the fix was in. Cavs stepped up in game 7 though. 

That’s the only reason I was glad KD joined. A three year period where he had no chance at winning the finals because of the ring the refs handed him on a silver platter in 2016

>And he didn’t stop there. The ESPN.com report indicates Green’s next call was to KD. **It’s unclear what Green said to him—he didn’t elaborate while speaking with ESPN.com’s Zach Lowe—but he clearly wasted no time trying to convince KD to come to Golden State.** He didn't even pull out of the Oracle Arena parking lot before doing it. ""That was my very next call,"" Green said, before talking about how he now sees the Warriors losing the 2016 NBA Finals as a blessing in disguise. ""If we win the championship, I’m like 99 percent sure we don’t get him. There are silver linings to everything.""

>**This isn’t the first time Green has admitted to essentially begging KD to join the Warriors.** During an interview with DraftKings last July, he revealed that he sent ""too many text messages"" to him during the recruitment process. But back then, he denied trying to recruit KD before NBA free agency opened up. So many NBA fans are now wondering if what Green did after Game 7 would constitute as tampering, which is something that’s not allowed in the NBA. Players aren’t technically supposed to recruit free agents-to-be before free agency starts.",Lakers,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uz79as/kd_replies_to_someone_posting_the_warriors/,0.9371,0.133,0.803,0.063

2022-05-28,302born,How is it his fault he can’t defend guards? That’s not in centers job. There’s only a select few centers that can actually take that responsibility. Majority can not. Maybe if Denver had some defenders that could prevent Jokic from being in that position it wouldn’t leave him on an island. That’s like saying Steph isn’t any good because every time he gets switched on centers he gets cooked. Like of course lol.

Mbappe, Messi and Cristian Ronaldo are outliers. Two of the latter are the greatest players to ever play the game and Mbappe is a potential all time great playing for an overpaying team that is owned by the Qatari government. 

NBA players by enlarge make a lot more money. You got below average NBA players easily raking in $50-$60 million dollars in career earnings. 

You have guys like Gorgui Dieng doing $71 million in career earnings and still going. 

This is unheard of for most soccer players. The English Premier League is the richest leave in the world. An above average player in England is earning $2-$8 million a year. Only a handful make over $20 million. 

There is no such thing as super max or veteran or rookie contract. You get paid based on your performance and the club you play for.

But I don't know how the Ligue One (France top football league) works with salaries.

But since you bought low, you can sell to all the suckers getting in late for a huge profit."" They don't even pretend that there's any intrinsic value to the coins, it's all about short-term speculative value that can be quickly offloaded.

I'll give you that the people buying the meme coins likely don't think they're doing anything wrong. Maybe they image the sucker they're selling to is one of the rich trust-fund kids, or (more likely) they don't humanize them at all.

2022-05-28,bicbrownboi,"I agree on the help point, but ultimately you want the option of playing man defense when the situation calls for it. Especially against great coaching like Kerr. Imagine Steph, Klay, JP, Wiggins and Dray out there simultaneously. 

It creates a situation where Miami has to cover one of GSWs elite guard scorers with Robinson, Strus, Vincent, Oladipo, Herro, Martin, or Vincent, and another with Lowry (who’s an above average defender compared to the league, but at this tier? In the NBA finals against the best of the best? He’s comparatively average. Worse on ball defender than Steph this season and worse team defense.)

Compare that to Boston, who have Smart, Brown, and White to throw at any guards, Tatum who can switch onto most guards, and Williams + Horford to cover the paint?

CP3 is all time either injured or is on an injured team. I’d rather take him over harden and westbrook though, he’s definitely done better than them. 

However I’d take the lebrons and jimmy butlers over cp3 Ofc. They’re more durable and able to elevate their game to a much greater extent, not to mention they possess size which is much more important in the playoffs unless you shoot like steph. Not sold on Luka yet, I’d rather take Jimmy over Luka bc Jimmy is miles better on defense and Luka sucks on that end.

2022-05-28,photowanderer,"Exactly, I was looking through to see if anyone make this comment. The context leading up to the game was very different. LeBron had all the pressure in the world, career-defining game after the previous year failure against the Mavs.

Leading up to this was the ridicule from the finals against the Mavs of how LeBron doesn't have the clutch gene and disappeared in the 4th quarter. This coupled with the infamous heatles press conference ""not 1, not 2, not 3,..."" were the classic jokes back then.

Correctly or not, up until that point, LeBron was perceived as disappearing under high pressure, and losing this game would pretty much ratchet up the hate machine.

He said before the game that he would play all game and came out on a mission. Was just ridiculous how he dominated that game, made all the difficult shots, off balance, long 3, and everything in between, absolutely unguardable.",NA,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uzerky/jimmy_butlers_seasonsaving_game_6_performance/,-0.936,0.044,0.816,0.139

2022-05-28,narmerguy,"If you are going to compare it to a specific game (Lebron Game 6 2012 vs Boston) a typical person expects that what makes them comparable is the very thing that makes the well-known game special. What made that game special was the context coupled with the dominant performance. It was the dominance in spite of all the history and narratives and expectations. 

Boston for the Lebron game wasn't just some opponent located in the city of Boston, it was _the_ team that had beaten him so many times that it forced him to upend the entire NBA by joining forces with Wade and Bosh. It was a team that mocked him and had already won a championship. Boston means nothing to Jimmy, and to be honest today's Boston means frankly nothing to anyone except maybe Kyrie. They are a young team that has proven nothing and won nothing. So when you say the games are comparable because they both faced ""Boston"" in a game 6 elimination, they're not really facing the same ""Boston"" at all. None of the players, none of the coaches, not even the same GM. Just the jerseys. 

If the Raptors had ever come back from behind to beat the Lebron Cavaliers on the strength of a transcendent 40-point performance from Lowry or Derozan, that would have been more comparable to Lebron's 2012 Game 6 than what Jimmy did tonight. 

I'm not trying to say you can't find similarities between Jimmy's Game 6 scenario and Lebron's. I'm saying those similarities are so inconsequential to what made Lebron's game iconic that they trivialize the context that made 2012 ECF Game 6 a memorable NBA reference point in the first place.",NA,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uzerky/jimmy_butlers_seasonsaving_game_6_performance/,0.886,0.081,0.872,0.046

In fact you could argue Butler's overall stats are better with 8 assists to 1 turnover vs LeBron's 5 assists to 4 turnover. Butler also did this with an injured knee which no one is bringing up. The only thing you can't debate was LeBron's game was an elimination game and higher pressure, therefore will be better remembered.",NA,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uzerky/jimmy_butlers_seasonsaving_game_6_performance/,-0.5956,0.078,0.808,0.114

LeBron didn't have an efficient playmaker game at 5 assists and 4 turnovers. Butler had 8 assists on an absurd 1 turnover and was carrying trash all game.

So i simply wouldn't count this game to argue that tatum was inconsistent like you were doing with Jimmy.

You brought up 27 points in 3 games to argue that Jimmy was inconsistent.

Jordan was a high flying mid range god that could slash and knife thru a defense to the cup. Bron is similar to jordan in that regard but imo a better finisher, less of a shooter, but more of a playmaker.

>The two sides met at the Hamptons on New York's Long Island. **To convince Durant**, four Warriors stars attended the meeting: Stephen Curry, **Draymond Green**, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala.

Now he's denying it all.  Receipts.

EDIT: and more:

>And he didn’t stop there. The ESPN.com report indicates Green’s next call was to KD. It’s unclear what Green said to him—he didn’t elaborate while speaking with ESPN.com’s Zach Lowe—but he clearly wasted no time trying to convince KD to come to Golden State. He didn't even pull out of the Oracle Arena parking lot before doing it. ""That was my very next call,"" Green said, before talking about how he now sees the Warriors losing the 2016 NBA Finals as a blessing in disguise. ""If we win the championship, I’m like 99 percent sure we don’t get him. There are silver linings to everything.""

>This isn’t the first time Green has admitted to essentially begging KD to join the Warriors. During an interview with DraftKings last July, he revealed that he sent ""too many text messages"" to him during the recruitment process. But back then, he denied trying to recruit KD before NBA free agency opened up.

But even then that's clearly not the same level as swinging from behind on a player who is already in the air with momentum.
