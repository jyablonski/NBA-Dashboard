2022-04-21,shakehasbignuts,"I used to play like Embiid. He is reckless on purpose.

When I see Embiid play as he is now it reminds me of how I used to play and it is frustrating and pisses me off that the NBA allows it. Not proud of it, I was known as Shaq on my local streetball court and went through a phase when I charged hard at everything. Big hard turns to my blindside, didn't care who was there. Charge right into the lane. Smash into the best offensive player on D while going for the ball, come what may. Limited offensive moves. So make no mistake about it. Embiid knows what he's doing. He knows people will be injured. He knows his skillset is limited and this is how he can win. He knows people will give way when he drives, think twice on their drives, etc. He will only be stopped by a stronger player and/or fearless players like Giannis, Gasol, Draymond, etc. Or by an obviously more skilled player with equal Type A like Ibaka.",76ers,511,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/u8dtet/highlight_embiid_on_how_his_game_winner_compares/,-0.6278,0.136,0.684,0.18

Not proud of it, I was known as Shaq on my local streetball court and went through a phase when I charged hard at everything. Big hard turns to my blindside, didn't care who was there. Charge right into the lane. Smash into the best offensive player on D while going for the ball, come what may. Limited offensive moves. So make no mistake about it. Siakam knows what he's doing. He knows people will be injured. He knows his skillset is limited and this is how he can win. He knows people will give way when he drives, think twice on their drives, etc. He will only be stopped by a stronger player and/or fearless players like Giannis, Gasol, Draymond, etc. Or by an obviously more skilled player with equal Type A like Ibaka. He didn't intend to injure, but he certainly intends to show you that he doesn't care if you get hurt when he rumbles into you. At least that's how I used to play. But that was streetball. Eventually I got more moves, played w better players, played real basketball w refs.

Turning point of the game was when Nets had a 5 point lead in the 4th. Nash called a time out, but instead of drawing up a play it was again another ISO. Celtics went on a 14-2 run and that was game. At least Udoka realized his big 2 were struggling, and instead asked them to be play makers instead of isolation players.

I‚Äôve always said this series will come down to coaching. Nash already blew game 1. In that game, Nets we‚Äôre up 1 with 39 seconds to go.

Hilarious when you think back on their season. It's not like their dumpster-fire lasted a couple games to start the season, or even 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 games or something.

Anyone who looked at Celtics game threads for the first ~30 games or took a peek into the Celtics subs knows just how down and out people thought this team was.

Also Tatum (that block on Durant was so nasty) and JB really showing why Celtics are the best defensive team. Say what you want about Smart, but the overall length and athleticism the Celtics have is insane. Especially when they get timelord back. Horford is surprisingly mobile on defense given his age, and having Timelord instead of Theis as his counterpart will elevate their defense even more.

Timelord, Zion, Simmons, Luka, Booker, will be interesting to see if/when these guys come back.

2022-04-21,helix400,"This literally happened with Derek Fisher and the Jazz in a playoff game.

Fisher was out of town for family matters.  The Jazz were having problems, their only remaining point guard got a bad neck injury and left the game on a stretcher.  AK 47 was left to play point guard.

Meanwhile, Fisher got a chartered flight into Salt Lake City. He landed and was quickly ushered to a car.  TNT showed a local news media helicopter following Fisher's police escort to the arena.  Fisher arrived by the 3rd quarter and quickly suited up.  He ran down the tunnel, Jerry Sloan didn't even let him sit, he just sent Fisher straight into the game, and Fisher made a handful of big plays to help win it.

2022-04-21,SharpMind94,"I was downvoted for saying that the Nets had no chance in this series. 

There are a lot of issues with the Nets. You have an alpha player in KD that can cook when he isn't being pressed by a strong defender. 

You have Kyrie who looks lost on the floor and letting players swing by him to score points. 

Then you have players tricking Nash to use a challenge. When it was clearly a foul. 

Then you have a team thats lateraling the ball like in football and scoring on you. Thats a coaching issue and the team should be pressing full court on the Celtics.

There‚Äôs a lack of cohesiveness with the Nets at the moment and Nash needs to straighten out Kyrie and KD to get their shit together 

Otherwise Boston is going to sweep the Series. Nets going back to NY won‚Äôt do much and Simmons coming back in game 5 and 6 isn‚Äôt going to do much either if Boston take a win in NY.

2022-04-21,duplicatesnowflake,"More like Kyrie should consider suiting up as coach. Both of these losses are low-key on Nash as much as KD.

No movement off ball.
No set plays.
Team looks rattled.
KD is allowed to dribble into swarming defense again and again without the ball even touching the hands of a guard in the half court.

What has Nash ever done as a coach exactly? The team disintegrates whenever KD is out. They didn't take care of business when they had the chance against the Bucks while Ky was healthy. The end game play calls in that series were basically to have KD dribble out the clock and shoot contested threes.

2022-04-21,chitownbulls92,"If Derozan missed the layup then it actually benefits you guys for not sending Derozan to the line for 2 freethrows...

It's indicative of the contact that the bucks were allowed to use since the refs thought the Pat foul was reasonable contact within the game. If Derozan missed (which he had a good chance of missing because he was clearly fouled with no call) then it actually favours the Bucks in a 1 possession game.

2022-04-21,cilantrope,"I think FVV is a serviceable piece at his salary if he plays less than 35 minutes a game during the regular season and has something left for the playoffs. He got put out there for 42+ minutes a game during the season and wasn't the same post All-star break and injuries.

Siakam in his current role is similar to DeMar (when he was a Raptor) in not delivering the value of a max player with low shooting inefficiency and turnovers at critical times being problems. He has some big regular season games but is nullified in the playoffs by a good defender and the more physical play. He was better in 2019, shooting with crazy efficiency, bringing energy, running the fast break, and being a second or third option (similar to what Boucher provides but with a different skill set). But due to injuries and some increased weight for strength, he's not the gazelle he once was.

Many Toronto fans don't tolerate criticism of the current ""star"", so it's difficult to have a discussion about Siakam (as it was with DeMar) because they interpret criticism as a personal attack rather than just honest feedback about a player. The Raptors tend to select personally likeable individuals so it is understandable. Ultimately, I think it is unlikely the Raptors will have much postseason success with Siakam eating up such a large portion of the salary cap and providing too little value on the court for it.",NA,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/u8dfx8/post_game_thread_the_philadelphia_76ers_30_defeat/,0.9832,0.17,0.757,0.073

2022-04-21,FearlessReason1925,Not really.  Your talking pre 5 second and hand check rules.   Defense was stiff AF.  Slower paced game also because of that.  30 really meant a lot back then.  Now days a lot of players can throw down 30 here or there. 40 was like insane.  Those rules changed the game.  When Jordan left they started plotting right away how they could make the game easier for jordanesque stuff to happen.  Hand check and paint rules made it so many people could drive to the rim and pull off crazy finishers. And it was a good move.  The game is fast paced exciting and fun to watch.  The only issue is comparing eras now.  Which I personally hate.  You cant accurately compare the eras now.  Noone should even try.

2022-04-21,salmans13,"Own Hart hurt his neck. I think compressed spine and he lost feeling in his legs. Not sure if it was broken. It's fake but also real dangerous. 


My friend was an indy small town wrestler and  dude was often more hurt than I ever was when I actually sparred with GSP, an actual MMA goat and a few other pro MMA guys at Tristar.   Obviously, they didn't go all out on us amateurs. 

Wrestlers learn to break falls and brace themselves and make it easy on the other guy jumping on them and things like that but that sort of bumps take their toll. 

My friend was 6'4 260 ish so he was usually the guy they were jumping on since she was huge for the amateur circuit.  He'd catch these guys who were 220 and told me he'd throw his back and stuff like that. If somebody overjumoed, he'd get a knee to  chest instead.  Since they were amateurs ,  it wasn't as smooth as the best if the best.  Chipped tooth, black eyes, bloody nose etc.  

He used to say it was like doing a deadlift while standing on water  while the barbell was being thrown at you. Even if you can do it , eventually, you'd pull a muscle because you can't keep proper form when running and jumping. Guy stopped after a serious concussion.

So after getting fouled Embiid can either take a shitty shot and have it miss and be rebounded, or he can just fall out of bounds without trying to save himself since he knows VanVleet pushed him out of bounds.

One of those two options is putting the punishment for the foul happening on Embiid, and the other option is putting the punishment for the foul on VanVleet.

2022-04-21,GreasedandLeased,"Sure. Most superstars idolize AI, not just for his play of course, Lebron and Steph included. 

Re: Dr J, Magic and early Jordan were comparable sized wings, of course all a little different, but I don‚Äôt think this criteria alone is a huge decider in my overall logic. As a total package and prime career I don‚Äôt think Dr J is as impressive as the other two. By the flip side I wouldn‚Äôt penalize certain players for playing in much more competitive eras (as clearly the case with AI and Embiid).

2022-04-21,GreasedandLeased,"No disrespect to Dr J, but Iverson better than Dr J and certainly in the eyes of fans. And Embiid is already a better all around player than Dr J. Saying otherwise is just putting more emphasis on the championship he won.

Iverson > Embiid > Dr J in terms of their on court impact, arguably Embiid is starting to eclipse AI with his potential. 

AI was nothing short of amazing and at his size did it night in/out and carried completely pedestrian rosters to the finals in incredible playoff runs (The OG Raptors-Sixers series anyone?? 2 50 point games winning a close game 7). You can criticize part of his game, but the man was incredible and literally put entire teams on his back playing 40+ mins a night some playoff games literally barely sitting 2 minutes.

2022-04-21,GreasedandLeased,"I don‚Äôt think I am if you read additional comments. Legitimate cases can be made and I‚Äôd wager some of the more serious fans and bball minds in my network would agree. 

Most can agree it‚Äôs hard and at times futile to compare players from different eras, but I will admit I‚Äôve always had an inclination to value modern players from the 90s onwards highly on absolute terms basis inherently as a result of the irrefutably significantly more competitive era they played in. Just to paint an extreme picture, vast majority of PGs from the 80s and before can‚Äôt even be mentioned in the same breath as those playing today on absolute terms. They‚Äôre on average absurdly more skilled and athletic today. I‚Äôm simply less interested in relative greatness - that is, players that stood out among their peers, when it comes to deciding which players based on the level of play they achieved were superior. Salute and recognize them for what they did/were, but generally speaking they played in eras that are dramatically inferior from a competitive standpoint due to globalization and global economic development, advance of the internet, and corresponding massive disparity in earnings/fame potential. Of course natural advances in sports science and analytics. 

It‚Äôs fine to have an alternate view, but I don‚Äôt see how I‚Äôm disrespecting Dr J in my comments. What I‚Äôm about to say alone isn‚Äôt necessarily a great argument, but most of serious Sixers would probably place AI over Embiid and Dr J so I don‚Äôt see how I‚Äôm particularly disrespectful. I‚Äôm not even saying it‚Äôs a huge difference.",NA,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/u8dktm/highlight_embiid_is_fired_up_at_the_end_of_game_3/,0.9856,0.161,0.786,0.053
2022-04-21,GreasedandLeased,"Fair points. No I do not, but close. AI‚Äôs career accolades are similar, though he played in a more competitive era with likely inferior teams. He never won a ring, Dr J‚Äôs NBA title team was stacked and he wasn‚Äôt the most important player in the team. Moses Malone dominated those finals. AI never had that luxury.

I know about Dr J, have watched some footage and a doc though it‚Äôs been some time and won‚Äôt pretend to have the best understanding, but considering the differences in the state of the leagues I‚Äôm more impressed both by what AI could do/skills and what he consistently delivered in particularly in the playoffs. Nearly everything you mention also applies to AI but he did it in a more competitive era against better players. That doesn‚Äôt take away from Erving‚Äôs greatness, as I‚Äôve explained I have a natural bias towards modern players that are inherently better in absolute terms (not necessarily relative terms, inherently it‚Äôs more challenging to be the cream of the crop relative to peers in a much more competitive league). At face value playing like AI did is more challenging and impressive. 

Embiid‚Äôs career is still unfolding and I think it‚Äôs harder to rank him compared to the other two the more I think about it and I‚Äôm partially considering where I think he‚Äôll land. His skill set is transcendent and he was elite from the second he stepped on an NBA floor which is crazy coming off two straight rehab years to start his career and not having all that many competitive bball years under his belt at that time. He may end up with similar accolades as the other two, clearly he‚Äôs MVP category today among a larger pool of MVP caliber players, a great defender, one of if not the most well rounded offensive game from a center ever. I mean as a player of his profile it‚Äôs damn near impossible to be better, there aren‚Äôt holes in his game. He dominates the paint and has probably the best shooting touch for a C of all time. Mid range, fading away either shoulder, 3s, step back jumpers. He‚Äôs near the limit of what‚Äôs possible from a player of his mold.

Accolades aren‚Äôt distinguishing factors in this comparison in my opinion. All 3 are great players, in my opinion the end product of quality of play AI and Embiid produced is higher overall. This is partially unfair to Julius because again, for many reasons beyond his control the overall competitiveness in his time was lower and it‚Äôs highly likely he‚Äôd have been a better player if he played today, but I simply don‚Äôt care about that.

2022-04-21,WindyCity54,"I'm not sure they even get past Chicago at this point. Not at least with how Holiday is playing (and now it becomes even harder because he'll be exclusively guarded by Caruso). As of now, the only guys they have to create on the perimeter are Holiday, Giannis (which we've seen how that played out in 2019 & 2020), and.... Grayson Allen? Jevon Carter? It's a very similar issue that the Suns now face without Booker where their only creator is CP3. 

The good thing is they're still loaded with shooting, and they've played well without Middleton in the past (4th Q vs Brooklyn this season, stretches in the 4th Q tonight). But it's going to take some interior dominance from Giannis/Lopez/(Portis if/when he comes back) to win the series.

2022-04-21,superstonkape,"Being as unbiased as I can here - the sixers theoretically were one win away from being the two seed. Considering Jokic missed less games than Embiid it‚Äôs very feasible that they win that extra game with him, as the way I see it Philly is roughly a push with Jokic replacing. He likely elevates the players around him in a way Embiid doesn‚Äôt based on their different skill sets and his ability to run point center.  They obviously take a sizable hit on defense but I‚Äôm not sure it would be so large that it loses them more games than they did already. Defense is where the debate lies here

However for the nuggets - as incredible as Embiid is (and in my opinion deserving of this years MVP - but that‚Äôs beside the point) I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs raising the floor of the would be lottery team the nuggets are without Jokic. He truly is a phenomenal playmaker and the offense runs through him in a way that would not be possible through Embiid. While with their current roster Embiid might be able to average something ridiculous like 35-15 or some shit the team would be completely one dimensional. There would not be a single legitimate playmaker and Embiid-Gordon would probably be a worse ‚Äòstar combo‚Äô (if you can call it that, gordon is just their second best player) than Embiid-Simmons. Not to mention the nuggets don‚Äôt have any players to space the floor for Embiid. I would imagine this team finishes somewhere in the play in game range personally. 

There‚Äôs a reason you can‚Äôt just swap the two players as the rosters are constructed around the two, and denver is obviously handicapped not having their second and third best players.",76ers,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/u8da93/highlight_embiid_ridiculous_360_fadeaway_jumper/,-0.3076,0.087,0.819,0.094

There are currently 2 of us actively developing.

Absolutely, the infrastructure is fairly new so plenty of room for improvement, the biggest one on the horizon being a centralized logging stack.

> Will there be ongoing projects or is this considered to be a one-off project (to build a Discord and Reddit bot)?

On-going/new projects for both the subreddit and discord, and we're always open to new ideas.

> Are there any expectations or strict deadlines considering volunteers could be full-time employees?

None at all, all of us do this in our free time at our convenience, we don't have any expectations of time or work put in.

> When would we expect to hear back after applying and any formal process afterwards (interviews)?

You better put some respect on Kukoc name. Many players can only dream of the resume Toni has. 

>I dont give a fuck if hes kd or kyrie they was shooting badly so be a distraction and pass the ball to the guys who are hot which seth/Dragic/Brown, Celtics

It's fucking KD if anyone gets the benefit of the doubt It's him. No one expected him to have the worst second half of his career. Normally it's a pretty safe assumption he's going to make more shots than role players.

>I would have said fuck that and kept the ball if KD and kyrie was shooting like ass

And you would've been benched for the playoffs, cut in the off-season and probably never play meaningful minutes again because you put yourself over your coach and team.

2022-04-21,el_mapache_negro,"> I'm just using examples, also. Again it depends on the amount of games they cut off. If it goes from 82 to 72 then it's likely to not be a big deal but if they break it to 58? That's gonna make certain all time records impossible to beat. For instance once Lebron breaks Kareems scoring record next season if they choose to do a 58 game season going forward I don't see anyone catching him. He spent a career averaging 70+ games a season averaging 27 a game for going on 20 years.

Sure but...who cares?  Do you think being the all time playoff points leader important right now?

> Even if someone plays all 58 games every season for 20 years which just won't happen they are still on average 12 games behind. Even if they averaged 30ppg they'd missed out on 360 points a season or 7200 points in 20 years. That's what? a bit over 1/5th of the points needed to break the record lost purely because of less games per season.

You're absolutely right, I just don't know why that should make me care.  

I'm against shortening the season because I like basketball.  So...play it.  People saying the season should be shortened because people are getting hurt?  They're dumb.

Dr J and Barkeley was amazing but relative to comparable greats of their time in their positions, AI outshines them during his time as a Sixer. Embiid as we know has it all as a modern center, and pending how the next few years unfold he could eclipse AI. 

At a generous 6‚Äô 160 lbs (he was actually 1-2‚Äù shorter) Iverson not only made otherwise completely pedestrian squads successful with historic playoff runs but managed to rip a win in the finals from Kobe and Shaq who had literally swept their way through the western playoffs. You read that right, a tough western conference and they were 12-0 before little AI dropped 48 on their heads to take game 1 carrying role players. Kobe and Shaq are effectively Jordan and Wilt‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs insane to think about, and it was also after consecutive 7 game series against the Raptors and Bucks. Those playoffs are insane.

My argument is that Giannis didn't commit a foul, didn't initiate illegal contact. And that no such foul as over the back exists, and most people using that phrase simply do not understand the rules which is why it's most common in middle and high school gyms.

I'm totally against people crying that the 82 game season is too long.  These are whiny zoomers (but I repeat myself), but that doesn't mean NBA records are anything close to consistent.  The game that resulted in Wilt averaging 50 points and Cousy shooting under 40% is a result of a basketball game that was literally just running down the court as fast as possible and shooting a shot.  It's not like the NBA today.  

So shit has already changed a lot.  82 games only affects team records: 73-9, 72-10, 69-13, 69-13.  Otherwise, it's not that important.",NA,-2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/u8fi7l/charania_bucks_forward_khris_middleton_has_a/,-0.9086,0,0.874,0.126

the only ones ppl think were bad were Nash over Shaq and that's bc shaq bitches about it every few months and their stats weren't even close to comparable. 

Jokic winning over embiid isn't even the closest MVP race in the past 5 years lol

if embiid doesn't win a single MVP then maybe ppl would think it was a robbery but even then, like Jokic put up 27/14/8 in a historic season lol. he obviously deserved it, so did Embiid and Giannis.
